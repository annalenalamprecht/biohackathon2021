This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Microbial communities have become a major research focus due to their importance for bio-geochemical cycles, biomedicine and biotechnological applications. While some biotechnological applications, such as anaerobic digestion, make use of naturally arising microbial communities, the rational design of microbial consortia for bio-based production processes has recently gained much interest. One class of synthetic microbial consortia is based on specifically designed strains of one species. A common design principle for these consortia is based on division of labor, where the entire production pathway is divided between the different strains to reduce the metabolic burden caused by product synthesis. We first show that classical division of labor does not automatically reduce the metabolic burden when metabolic flux per biomass is analyzed. We then present ASTHERISC (Algorithmic Search of THERmodynamic advantages in Single-species Communities), a new computational approach for designing multi-strain communities of a single-species with the aim to divide a production pathway between different strains such that the thermodynamic driving force for product synthesis is maximized. ASTHERISC exploits the fact that compartmentalization of segments of a product pathway in different strains can circumvent thermodynamic bottlenecks arising when operation of one reaction requires a metabolite with high and operation of another reaction the same metabolite with low concentration. We implemented the ASTHERISC algorithm in a dedicated program package and applied it on E. coli core and genome-scale models with different settings, for example, regarding number of strains or demanded product yield. These calculations showed that, for each scenario, many target metabolites (products) exist where a multi-strain community can provide a thermodynamic advantage compared to a single strain solution. In some cases, a production with sufficiently high yield is thermodynamically only feasible with a community. In summary, the developed ASTHERISC approach provides a promising new principle for designing microbial communities for the bio-based production of chemicals.","title":"Designing microbial communities to maximize the thermodynamic driving force for the production of chemicals","authors":[{"name":"Bekiaris P.S."},{"name":"Klamt S."}]},"pmid":"34129600","pmcid":"PMC8232427","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1371/JOURNAL.PCBI.1009093"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2563-7561","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Steffen Klamt","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"klamt@mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Chan019","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":[],"license":"Apache-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:astherisc","biotoolsID":"astherisc","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-10-18T11:13:40.129278Z","name":"ASTHERISC","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"},{"term":"Enzymes","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0821"},{"term":"Endocrinology and metabolism","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3407"},{"term":"Biotechnology","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3297"}],"additionDate":"2021-10-18T11:13:40.126613Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/klamt-lab/astheriscPackage"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[{"note":null,"type":["Discussion forum"],"url":"https://github.com/graphia-app/graphia/discussions"},{"note":null,"type":["Issue tracker"],"url":"https://github.com/graphia-app/graphia/issues"},{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/graphia-app"}],"description":"A platform for the graph-based visualisation and analysis of complex data.\n\nVisualisation tool for the creation and analysis of graphs.\n\nGraphia is a powerful open source visual analytics application developed to aid the interpretation of large and complex datasets.\n\nGraphia can create and visualise graphs from tables of numeric data and display the structures that result.

The most important features making lipids different from general metabolites are their various characteristics, including their lipid classes, double bonds, chain lengths, etc. Based on these characteristics, lipid species can be classified into different categories and, more interestingly, exert specific biological functions in a group. In an effort to simplify lipidomic analysis workflows and enhance the exploration of lipid characteristics, we have developed a highly flexible and user-friendly web server called LipidSig. It consists of five sections, namely, Profiling, Differential Expression, Correlation, Network and Machine Learning, and evaluates lipid effects on cellular or disease phenotypes. One of the specialties of LipidSig is the conversion between lipid species and characteristics according to a user-defined characteristics table. This function allows for efficient data mining for both individual lipids and subgroups of characteristics. To expand the server's practical utility, we also provide analyses focusing on fatty acid properties and multiple characteristics. In summary, LipidSig is expected to help users identify significant lipid-related features and to advance the field of lipid biology.

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Advances in mass spectrometry enabled high throughput profiling of lipids but differential analysis and biological interpretation of lipidomics datasets remains challenging. To overcome this barrier, we present LipidSuite, an end-to-end differential lipidomics data analysis server. LipidSuite offers a step-by-step workflow for preprocessing, exploration, differential analysis and enrichment analysis of untargeted and targeted lipidomics. Three lipidomics data formats are accepted for upload: mwTab file from Metabolomics Workbench, Skyline CSV Export, and a numerical matrix. Experimental variables to be used in analysis are uploaded in a separate file. Conventional lipid names are automatically parsed to enable lipid class and chain length analyses. Users can interactively explore data, choose subsets based on sample types or lipid classes or characteristics, and conduct univariate, multivariate and unsupervised analyses. For complex experimental designs and clinical cohorts, LipidSuite offers confounding variables adjustment.

With lipidomics datasets becoming increasingly available, lipidomic-focused software tools are required to facilitate data analysis as well as mining of public datasets, integrating lipidomics-unique molecular information such as lipid class, chain length, and unsaturation. To address this need, we developed lipidr, an open-source R/Bioconductor package for data mining and analysis of lipidomics datasets. lipidr implements a comprehensive lipidomic-focused analysis workflow for targeted and untargeted lipidomics. lipidr imports numerical matrices, Skyline exports, and Metabolomics Workbench files directly into R, automatically inferring lipid class and chain information from lipid names. Through integration with the Metabolomics Workbench API, users can search, download, and reanalyze public lipidomics datasets seamlessly. lipidr allows thorough data inspection, normalization, and uni-and multivariate analyses, displaying results as interactive visualizations. To enable interpretation of lipid class, chain length, and total unsaturation data, we also developed and implemented a novel lipid set enrichment analysis. A companion online guide with two live example datasets is presented at https://www.lipidr.org/. We expect that the ease of use and innovative features of lipidr will allow the lipidomics research community to gain novel detailed insights from lipidomics data.","title":"Lipidr: A Software Tool for Data Mining and Analysis of Lipidomics Datasets","authors":[{"name":"Mohamed A."},{"name":"Molendijk J."},{"name":"Hill M.M."}]},"pmid":"32168452","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/ACS.JPROTEOME.0C00082"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Niclaskn","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Library"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:lipidr","biotoolsID":"lipidr","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-10-04T11:40:59.833564Z","name":"lipidr","topic":[{"term":"Lipids","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0153"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Data mining","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3473"},{"term":"Workflows","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0769"}],"additionDate":"2021-01-18T07:56:27Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://www.lipidr.org/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/sgsokol/isosolve"},{"note":null,"type":["Issue tracker"],"url":"https://github.com/sgsokol/isosolve/issues"}],"description":"IsoSolve an integrative framework to improve isotopic coverage and consolidate isotopic measurements by MS and/or NMR.

Current statistical approaches have been focusing on identifying small subsets of molecules (a \u2018molecular signature\u2019) to explain or predict biological conditions, but mainly for a single type of \u2018omics. In addition, commonly used methods are univariate and consider each biological feature independently. We introduce mixOmics, an R package dedicated to the multivariate analysis of biological data sets with a specific focus on data exploration, dimension reduction and visualisation. By adopting a systems biology approach, the toolkit provides a wide range of methods that statistically integrate several data sets at once to probe relationships between heterogeneous \u2018omics data sets. Our recent methods extend Projection to Latent Structure (PLS) models for discriminant analysis, for data integration across multiple \u2018omics data or across independent studies, and for the identification of molecular signatures.

Traditional data processing pipelines contain an alignment step to assemble the measurements of overlapping features across samples into a unified table. However, data sets acquired under nonidentical conditions are not amenable to this process, mostly due to significant alterations in chromatographic retention times. Alignment of features between disparately acquired LC-MS metabolomics data could aid collaborative compound identification efforts and enable meta-analyses of expanded data sets. Here, we describe metabCombiner, a new computational pipeline for matching known and unknown features in a pair of untargeted LC-MS data sets and concatenating their abundances into a combined table of intersecting feature measurements. metabCombiner groups features by mass-to-charge (m/z) values to generate a search space of possible feature pair alignments, fits a spline through a set of selected retention time ordered pairs, and ranks alignments by m/z, mapped retention time, and relative abundance similarity. We evaluated this workflow on a pair of plasma metabolomics data sets acquired with different gradient elution methods, achieving a mean absolute retention time prediction error of roughly 0.06 min and a weighted per-compound matching accuracy of approximately 90%. We further demonstrate the utility of this method by comprehensively mapping features in urine and muscle metabolomics data sets acquired from different laboratories. metabCombiner has the potential to bridge the gap between otherwise incompatible metabolomics data sets and is available as an R package at https://github.com/hhabra/metabCombiner and Bioconductor.","title":"MetabCombiner: Paired Untargeted LC-HRMS Metabolomics Feature Matching and Concatenation of Disparately Acquired Data Sets","authors":[{"name":"Habra H."},{"name":"Kachman M."},{"name":"Bullock K."},{"name":"Clish C."},{"name":"Evans C.R."},{"name":"Karnovsky A."}]},"pmid":"33724799","pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/ACS.ANALCHEM.0C03693"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7388-8520","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Alla Karnovsky","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"akarnovs@med.umich.edu","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6698-5330","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Charles R.

The metabolites can be used to define biomarkers used in medicine to find treatments for diseases or for the development of diagnostic tests or for the identification of pathogens such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).","language":["Python","JavaScript"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Software package","version":null,"url":"https://github.com/soerendip/ms-mint/releases"}],"validated":0,"function":[],"publication":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"soerendip","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Emerging","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://soerendip.github.io/ms-mint/"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application","Workbench","Desktop application"],"license":"MIT","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ms-mint","biotoolsID":"ms-mint","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-09-03T00:46:13Z","name":"MINT (Metabolomics Integrator)","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"}],"additionDate":"2021-09-03T00:06:28Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/soerendip/ms-mint"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"CyProduct is a software tool for accurately predicting the byproducts of human Cytochrome P450 metabolism.","language":["Java"],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Metabolic pathway prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3929"},{"term":"PTM site prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0417"},{"term":"Phasing","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3454"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2021-06-28T00:00:00Z","citationCount":0,"journal":"Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling","abstract":"Â© Published 2021 by American Chemical Society.In silico metabolism prediction is a cheminformatic task of autonomously predicting the set of metabolic byproducts produced from a specified molecule and a set of enzymes or reactions. Here, we describe a novel machine learned in silico cytochrome P450 (CYP450) metabolism prediction suite, called CyProduct, that accurately predicts metabolic byproducts for a specified molecule and a human CYP450 isoform. It includes three modules: (1) CypReact, a tool that predicts if the query compound reacts with a given CYP450 enzyme, (2) CypBoM, a tool that accurately predicts the \"bond site\"of the reaction (i.e., which specific bonds within the query molecule react with the CYP isoform), and (3) MetaboGen, a tool that generates the metabolic byproducts based on CypBoM's bond-site prediction. CyProduct predicts metabolic biotransformation products for each of the nine most important human CYP450 enzymes. CypBoM uses an important new concept called \"bond of metabolism\"(BoM), which extends the traditional \"site of metabolism\"(SoM) by specifying the information about the set of chemical bonds that is modified or formed in a metabolic reaction (rather than the specific atom). We created a BoM database for 1845 CYP450-mediated Phase I reactions, then used this to train the CypBoM Predictor to predict the reactive bond locations on substrate molecules. CypBoM Predictor's cross-validated Jaccard score for reactive bond prediction ranged from 0.380 to 0.452 over the nine CYP450 enzymes. Over variants of a test set of 68 known CYP450 substrates and 30 nonreactants, CyProduct outperformed the other packages, including ADMET Predictor, BioTransformer, and GLORY, by an average of 200% (with respect to Jaccard score) in terms of predicting metabolites.

Additionally, to ensure result interpretation by system biologists, we display the annotation in a network where observed mass peaks are connected if their candidate metabolites are substrate/product of known biochemical reactions. This graph can be overlaid with other graph-based analysis, such as partial correlation networks, in a visualization scheme exported to Cytoscape, with web and stand-alone versions.

The resulting LC-TIMS-MS data sets are, in general, several gigabytes in size and are stored in the proprietary Bruker Tims data format (TDF). The raw data can be accessed using proprietary binaries in C, C++, and Python on Windows and Linux operating systems. Here we introduce a suite of computer programs for data accession, including OpenTIMS, TimsR, and TimsPy. OpenTIMS is a C++ library capable of reading Bruker TDF files. It opens up Bruker's proprietary codebase. TimsPy and TimsR build on top of OpenTIMS, enabling swift and user-friendly data access to the raw data with Python and R. Both programs are available under a GPL3 license on all major platforms, extending the possibility to interact with timsTOF data to macOS. Additionally, OpenTIMS is capable of translating Bruker data into HDF5 files that can be easily analyzed from Python with the vaex module.

This online tool, called \u201cLM-GlycomeAtlas\u201d, allows users to visualize the LMA-based tissue glycomic profiling data associated with the sample information as an atlas.

We designed it to deposit multiple data sets of glycomic profiles with high-resolution histological images, which included staining images with multiple lectins on the array. The additionally implemented interfaces allow users to display multiple histological images of interest (e.g., diseased and normal mice), thereby facilitating the evaluation of tissue glycomic profiling and glyco-pathological analysis. Using these updated interfaces, 451 glycomic profiling data and 42 histological images obtained from 14 tissues of normal and diseased mice were successfully visualized. By easy integration with other tools for glycoproteomic data and protein glycosylation machinery, LM-GlycomeAtlas will be one of the most valuable open resources that contribute to both glycoscience

represents a powerful means of highlighting molecular mechanisms relevant to human diseases. However, a major challenge of this approach is to identify the causal gene(s) at the observed QTLs. Here, we present a framework for the Ã¢ \u20ac Prioritization of candidate causal Genes at Molecular QTLs' (ProGeM), which incorporates biological domain-specific annotation data alongside genome annotation data from multiple repositories. We assessed the performance of ProGeM using a reference set of 227 previously reported and extensively curated metabolite QTLs. For 98% of these loci, the expert-curated gene was one of the candidate causal genes prioritized by ProGeM. Benchmarking analyses revealed that 69% of the causal candidates were nearest to the sentinel variant at the investigated molecular QTLs, indicating that genomic proximity is the most reliable indicator of Ã¢ \u20ac true positive' causal genes. In contrast, cis-gene expression QTL data led to three false positive candidate causal gene assignments for every one true positive assignment. We provide evidence that these conclusions also apply to other molecular phenotypes, suggesting that ProGeM is a powerful and versatile tool for annotating molecular QTLs. ProGeM is freely available via GitHub.","title":"ProGeM: A framework for the prioritization of candidate causal genes at molecular quantitative trait loci","authors":[{"name":"Stacey D."},{"name":"Fauman E.B."},{"name":"Ziemek D."},{"name":"Sun B.B."},{"name":"Harshfield E.L."},{"name":"Wood A.M."},{"name":"Butterworth A.S."},{"name":"Suhre K."},{"name":"Paul D.S."}]},"pmid":"30239796","pmcid":"PMC6326795","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/NAR/GKY837"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1932-756X","typeEntity":"Person","name":"David Stacey","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"ds763@medschl.cam.ac.uk","url":null,"typeRole":[]},{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8230-0116","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Dirk S Paul","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"dsp35@medschl.cam.ac.uk","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Niclaskn","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Library"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:progem","biotoolsID":"progem","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-05-18T06:11:16Z","name":"ProGeM","topic":[{"term":"Genotype and phenotype","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0625"},{"term":"Lipids","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0153"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Gene expression","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0203"},{"term":"Epigenetics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3295"}],"additionDate":"2021-01-20T10:54:42Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/ds763/ProGeM"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"DaDIA is a LC-MS feature extraction and annotation workflow in R.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Feature extraction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3937"},{"term":"Natural product identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3803"},{"term":"Validation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2428"},{"term":"Peak detection","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3215"},{"term":"Retention time prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3633"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2021-02-02T00:00:00Z","citationCount":2,"journal":"Analytical Chemistry","abstract":"Â© 2021 American Chemical Society.Existing data acquisition modes such as full-scan, data-dependent (DDA), and data-independent acquisition (DIA) often present limited capabilities in capturing metabolic information in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In this work, we proposed a novel metabolomic data acquisition workflow that combines DDA and DIA analyses to achieve better metabolomic data quality, including enhanced metabolome coverage, tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) coverage, and MS2 quality. This workflow, named data-dependent-assisted data-independent acquisition (DaDIA), performs untargeted metabolomic analysis of individual biological samples using DIA mode and the pooled quality control (QC) samples using DDA mode. This combination takes advantage of the high-feature number and MS2 spectral coverage of the DIA data and the high MS2 spectral quality of the DDA data. To analyze the heterogeneous DDA and DIA data, we further developed a computational program, DaDIA.R, to automatically extract metabolic features and perform streamlined metabolite annotation of DaDIA data set. Using human urine samples, we demonstrated that the DaDIA workflow delivers remarkably improved data quality when compared to conventional DDA or DIA metabolomics. In particular, both the number of detected features and annotated metabolites were greatly increased. Further biological demonstration using a leukemia metabolomics study also proved that the DaDIA workflow can efficiently detect and annotate around 4 times more significant metabolites than DDA workflow with broad MS2 coverage and high MS2 spectral quality for downstream statistical analysis and biological interpretation. Overall, this work represents a critical development of data acquisition mode in untargeted metabolomics, which can greatly benefit untargeted metabolomics for a wide range of biological applications.","title":"DaDIA: Hybridizing Data-Dependent and Data-Independent Acquisition Modes for Generating High-Quality Metabolomic Data","authors":[{"name":"Guo J."},{"name":"Shen S."},{"name":"Xing S."},{"name":"Huan T."}]},"pmid":"33465307","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/ACS.ANALCHEM.0C05022"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6295-2435","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Tao Huan","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"thuan@chem.ubc.ca","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Kigaard","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Workflow"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:dadia","biotoolsID":"dadia","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-05-05T08:49:34Z","name":"DaDIA","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"}],"additionDate":"2021-03-19T08:30:35Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/HuanLab/DaDIA.git"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"CoPTR is a tool for accurate and robust inference of microbial growth dynamics from metagenomic sequencing.","language":["Python"],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Expression analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2495"},{"term":"Genome assembly","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0525"},{"term":"Read mapping","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3198"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":null,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1101/2021.02.02.429365"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Tal Korem","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"tk2829@cumc.columbia.edu","url":null,"typeRole":[]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Itsik Pe\u2019er","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"itsik@cs.columbia.edu","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Kigaard","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"https://coptr.readthedocs.io"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":[],"license":"GPL-3.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:coptr","biotoolsID":"coptr","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-04-26T14:21:37Z","name":"CoPTR","topic":[{"term":"Metagenomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3174"},{"term":"Metagenomic sequencing","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3837"},{"term":"Microbial ecology","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3697"},{"term":"Sequence assembly","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0196"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"}],"additionDate":"2021-03-19T09:11:09Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/tyjo/coptr"},{"otherID":[{"type":"rrid","value":"RRID:SCR_000467","version":null}],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":"Git repository link for the nmrML JAVA converter developed by Daniel Jacob","type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/nmrML/nmrML/tree/master/tools/Parser_and_Converters/Java"}],"description":"This tool is used to support the nmrML data standard for nuclear magnetic resonance raw data in metabolomics.

Here we present nmrML, an open XML-based exchange and storage format for NMR spectral data. The nmrML format is intended to be fully compatible with existing NMR data for chemical, biochemical, and metabolomics experiments. nmrML can capture raw NMR data, spectral data acquisition parameters, and where available spectral metadata, such as chemical structures associated with spectral assignments. The nmrML format is compatible with pure-compound NMR data for reference spectral libraries as well as NMR data from complex biomixtures, i.e., metabolomics experiments. To facilitate format conversions, we provide nmrML converters for Bruker, JEOL and Agilent/Varian vendor formats. In addition, easy-to-use Web-based spectral viewing, processing, and spectral assignment tools that read and write nmrML have been developed. Software libraries and Web services for data validation are available for tool developers and end-users. The nmrML format has already been adopted for capturing and disseminating NMR data for small molecules by several open source data processing tools and metabolomics reference spectral libraries, e.g., serving as storage format for the MetaboLights data repository. The nmrML open access data standard has been endorsed by the Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI), and we here encourage user participation and feedback to increase usability and make it a successful standard.","title":"NmrML: A Community Supported Open Data Standard for the Description, Storage, and Exchange of NMR Data","authors":[{"name":"Schober D."},{"name":"Jacob D."},{"name":"Wilson M."},{"name":"Cruz J.A."},{"name":"Marcu A."},{"name":"Grant J.R."},{"name":"Moing A."},{"name":"Deborde C."},{"name":"De Figueiredo L.F."},{"name":"Haug K."},{"name":"Rocca-Serra P."},{"name":"Easton J."},{"name":"Ebbels T.M.D."},{"name":"Hao J."},{"name":"Ludwig C."},{"name":"Gunther U.L."},{"name":"Rosato A."},{"name":"Klein M.S."},{"name":"Lewis I.A."},{"name":"Luchinat C."},{"name":"Jones A.R."},{"name":"Grauslys A."},{"name":"Larralde M."},{"name":"Yokochi M."},{"name":"Kobayashi N."},{"name":"Porzel A."},{"name":"Griffin J.L."},{"name":"Viant M.R."},{"name":"Wishart D.S."},{"name":"Steinbeck C."},{"name":"Salek R.M."},{"name":"Neumann S."}]},"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/acs.analchem.7b02795"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":"The main developer of the nmrML converter.","orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Daniel Jacob","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":null,"url":null,"typeRole":["Developer"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Project","name":"www.nmrML.org","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":null,"url":null,"typeRole":[]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Consortium","name":"COSMOS EU project","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":null,"url":null,"typeRole":[]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Consortium","name":"PheNoMeNal EU project","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":null,"url":null,"typeRole":[]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Daniel Jacob","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"info@nmrML.org","url":"https://github.com/nmrML/nmrML/tree/master/tools/Parser_and_Converters/Java","typeRole":["Primary contact"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Daniel Schober","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"dschober@ipb-halle.de","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":[]},"owner":"dschober","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[],"community":null,"version":["1.2"],"toolType":["Library"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:nmrml_converter","biotoolsID":"nmrml_converter","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-04-26T08:03:13Z","name":"nmrML converter","topic":[{"term":"NMR","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0593"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Data integration and warehousing","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3366"},{"term":"Ontology and terminology","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0089"},{"term":"Analytical chemistry","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3370"}],"additionDate":"2018-04-18T11:01:22Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://nmrml.org/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"an Integrated Software Package for the Analysis of 1D and 2D Thermal Profiling Data.\n\nThermal Profiling Meltome Analysis Program.","language":[],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Gene-set enrichment analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2436"},{"term":"Gene expression profiling","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0314"},{"term":"Quantification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3799"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":null,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1101/2021.02.22.432361"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Kilian V.M.

Others resort to correlation studies, cataloging pairwise relationships, but lacking an obvious approach for cohesive and interpretable summaries of these catalogs. Methods: We present a novel workflow for building predictive regression models from network neighborhoods in multi-omic networks. First, we generate pairwise regression models across all pairs of analytes from all omes, encoding the resulting \u201ctop table\u201d of relationships in a network. Then, we build predictive logistic regression models using the analytes in network neighborhoods of interest. We call this method CANTARE (Consolidated Analysis of Network Topology And Regression Elements). Results: We applied CANTARE to previously published data from healthy controls and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consisting of three omes: gut microbiome, metabolomics, and microbial-derived enzymes. We identified 8 unique predictive models with AUC > 0.90. The number of predictors in these models ranged from 3 to 13. We compare the results of CANTARE to random forests and elastic-net penalized regressions, analyzing AUC, predictions, and predictors. CANTARE AUC values were competitive with those generated by random forests and penalized regressions. The top 3 CANTARE models had a greater dynamic range of predicted probabilities than did random forests and penalized regressions (p-value = 1.35 Ã 10\u20135). CANTARE models were significantly more likely to prioritize predictors from multiple omes than were the alternatives (p-value = 0.005). We also showed that predictive models from a network based on pairwise models with an interaction term for IBD have higher AUC than predictive models built from a correlation network (p-value = 0.016). R scripts and a CANTARE User\u2019s Guide are available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/cytomelodics/files/CANTARE/. Conclusion: CANTARE offers a flexible approach for building parsimonious, interpretable multi-omic models. These models yield quantitative and directional effect sizes for predictors and support the generation of hypotheses for follow-up investigation.","title":"CANTARE: finding and visualizing network-based multi-omic predictive models","authors":[{"name":"Siebert J.C."},{"name":"Saint-Cyr M."},{"name":"Borengasser S.J."},{"name":"Wagner B.D."},{"name":"Lozupone C.A."},{"name":"Gorg C."}]},"pmid":"33607938","pmcid":"PMC7896366","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1186/S12859-021-04016-8"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Janet C.

We describe the Multigenomic Entropy Based Score pipeline (MEBS), a software platform designed to evaluate, compare, and infer complex metabolic pathways in large \"omic\" datasets, including entire biogeochemical cycles. MEBS is open source and available through https://github.com/eead-csic-compbio/metagenome Pfam score. To demonstrate its use, we modeled the sulfur cycle by exhaustively curating the molecular and ecological elements involved (compounds, genes, metabolic pathways, and microbial taxa). This information was reduced to a collection of 112 characteristic Pfam protein domains and a list of complete-sequenced sulfur genomes. Using the mathematical framework of relative entropy (H'), we quantitatively measured the enrichment of these domains among sulfur genomes. The entropy of each domain was used both to build up a final score that indicates whether a (meta)genomic sample contains the metabolic machinery of interest and to propose marker domains in metagenomic sequences such as DsrC (PF04358). MEBS was benchmarked with a dataset of 2107 non-redundant microbial genomes from RefSeq and 935 metagenomes from MG-RAST. Its performance, reproducibility, and robustness were evaluated using several approaches, including random sampling, linear regression models, receiver operator characteristic plots, and the area under the curve metric (AUC). Our results support the broad applicability of this algorithm to accurately classify (AUC = 0.985) hard-to-culture genomes (e.g., Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator), previously characterized ones, and metagenomic environments such as hydrothermal vents, or deep-sea sediment. Our benchmark indicates that an entropy-based score can capture the metabolic machinery of interest and can be used to efficiently classify large genomic and metagenomic datasets, including uncultivated/unexplored taxa.","title":"MEBS, a software platform to evaluate large (meta)genomic collections according to their metabolic machinery: Unraveling the sulfur cycle","authors":[{"name":"De Anda V."},{"name":"Zapata-Penasco I."},{"name":"Poot-Hernandez A.C."},{"name":"Eguiarte L.E."},{"name":"Contreras-Moreira B."},{"name":"Souza V."}]},"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/gigascience/gix096"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Valerie De Anda Torres","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"valdeanda@ciencias.unam.mx","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Augusto Cesar Poot-Hernandez","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"augusto.poot@iimas.unam.mx","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Bruno Contreras Moreira","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"bcontreras@eead.csic.es","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"d.gabrielaitis","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://github.com/eead-csic-compbio/metagenome_Pfam_score"},{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"https://eead-csic-compbio.github.io/metagenome_Pfam_score/manual.v1.pdf"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":"GPL-3.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mebs","biotoolsID":"mebs","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-04-22T05:52:06Z","name":"MEBS","topic":[{"term":"Metagenomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3174"},{"term":"Genomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0622"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Molecular interactions, pathways and networks","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0602"}],"additionDate":"2018-07-14T09:38:05Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/eead-csic-compbio/metagenome_Pfam_score"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[{"note":null,"type":["Other"],"url":"http://ceumass.eps.uspceu.es/mediator/index.xhtml"},{"note":"CEU Mass Mediator API","type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/lzyacht/cmmr"},{"note":null,"type":["Issue tracker"],"url":"https://github.com/lzyacht/cmmr/issues"}],"description":"Tool for looking up metabolites in different databases (Kegg, HMDB, LipidMaps, Metlin and MINE) from experimental masses obtained by mass spectrometry.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Score","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_1772"},"format":[{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]},{"data":{"term":"Compound ID (HMDB)","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2622"},"format":[{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]},{"data":{"term":"PubChem ID","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2639"},"format":[{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}],"input":[{"data":{"term":"Molecular mass","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0844"},"format":[{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]},{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry spectra","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Database search","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2421"},{"term":"Annotation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0226"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2018-05-30T00:00:00Z","citationCount":44,"journal":"Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis","abstract":"Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.CEU Mass Mediator (CMM) is an on-line tool for aiding researchers when performing metabolite annotation.

Molecular annotation of the detected signals is only possible if a high mass accuracy is maintained over the entire image and the m/z range. However, the change in the number of ions from pixel-to-pixel of the biological samples could lead to small fluctuations in the detected m/z-values, called mass shift. The use of internal calibration is known to offer the best solution to avoid, or at least to reduce, mass shifts. Their \u201ca priori\u201d selection for a global MSI acquisition is prone to false positive detection and therefore to poor recalibration. To fill this gap, this work describes an algorithm that recalibrates each spectrum individually by estimating its mass shift with the help of a list of pixel-specific internal calibrating ions, automatically generated in a data-adaptive manner (https://github.com/ LaRoccaRaphael/MSI_recalibration). Through a practical example, we applied the methodology to a zebrafish whole-body section acquired at a high mass resolution to demonstrate the impact of mass shift on data analysis and the capability of our algorithm to recalibrate MSI data.

Lack of complete operonic reference and functional information makes the prediction of metagenomic operons a challenging task; thus, opening new perspectives on the interpretation of the host-microbe interactions. Results: In this work, we identified whole-genome and metagenomic operons via MetaRon (Metagenome and whole-genome opeRon prediction pipeline). MetaRon identifies operons without any experimental or functional information. MetaRon was implemented on datasets with different levels of complexity and information. Starting from its application on whole-genome to simulated mixture of three whole-genomes (E. coli MG1655, Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv and Bacillus subtilis str. 16), E. coli c20 draft genome extracted from chicken gut and finally on 145 whole-metagenome data samples from human gut. MetaRon consistently achieved high operon prediction sensitivity, specificity and accuracy across E. coli whole-genome (97.8, 94.1 and 92.4%), simulated genome (93.7, 75.5 and 88.1%) and E. coli c20 (87, 91 and 88%,), respectively. Finally, we identified 1,232,407 unique operons from 145 paired-end human gut metagenome samples. We also report strong association of type 2 diabetes with Maltose phosphorylase (K00691), 3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononate 9-phosphate synthase (K21279) and an uncharacterized protein (K07101). Conclusion: With MetaRon, we were able to remove two notable limitations of existing whole-genome operon prediction methods: (1) generalizability (ability to predict operons in unrelated bacterial genomes), and (2) whole-genome and metagenomic data management. We also demonstrate the use of operons as a subset to represent the trends of secondary metabolites in whole-metagenome data and the role of secondary metabolites in the occurrence of disease condition. Using operonic data from metagenome to study secondary metabolic trends will significantly reduce the data volume to more precise data. Furthermore, the identification of metabolic pathways associated with the occurrence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) also presents another dimension of analyzing the human gut metagenome. Presumably, this study is the first organized effort to predict metagenomic operons and perform a detailed analysis in association with a disease, in this case type 2 diabetes. The application of MetaRon to metagenomic data at diverse scale will be beneficial to understand the gene regulation and therapeutic metagenomics.","title":"Prediction and analysis of metagenomic operons via MetaRon: a pipeline for prediction of Metagenome and whole-genome opeRons","authors":[{"name":"Zaidi S.S.A."},{"name":"Kayani M.U.R."},{"name":"Zhang X."},{"name":"Ouyang Y."},{"name":"Shamsi I.H."}]},"pmid":"33468056","pmcid":"PMC7814594","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1186/S12864-020-07357-5"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8545-660X","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Imran Haider Shamsi","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"drimran@zju.edu.cn","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Niclaskn","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:metaron","biotoolsID":"metaron","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-04-11T09:18:31Z","name":"MetaRon","topic":[{"term":"Gene structure","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0114"},{"term":"Metagenomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3174"},{"term":"Microbial ecology","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3697"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"}],"additionDate":"2021-03-19T08:48:39Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/zaidissa/MetaRon"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"A Python add-on to cobrapy for modifying human genome-scale metabolic reconstruction using the gut microbiota models.\n\nMicrobiota-to-Recon (M2R) program.","language":["Python"],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Metabolic network modelling","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3660"},{"term":"Aggregation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3436"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":null,"pmid":"33523116","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/BIOINFORMATICS/BTAB060"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Ewelina Weglarz-Tomczak","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"ewelina.weglarz.tomczak@gmail.com","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Niclaskn","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":"MIT","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:m2r","biotoolsID":"m2r","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-04-11T09:00:15Z","name":"M2R","topic":[{"term":"Endocrinology and metabolism","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3407"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"},{"term":"Physiology","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3300"},{"term":"Genotype and phenotype","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0625"}],"additionDate":"2021-03-19T09:07:30Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/e-weglarz-tomczak/m2r"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/theislab/squidpy_reproducibility"}],"description":"Squidpy - Spatial Single Cell Analysis in Python.\n\nSquidpy is a tool for the analysis and visualization of spatial molecular data.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Microorganisms produce secondary metabolites with a remarkable range of bioactive properties. The constantly increasing amount of published genomic data provides the opportunity for efficient identification of biosynthetic gene clusters by genome mining. On the other hand, for many natural products with resolved structures, the encoding biosynthetic gene clusters have not been identified yet. Of those secondary metabolites, the scaffolds of nonribosomal peptides and polyketides (type I modular) can be predicted due to their building block-like assembly. SeMPI v2 provides a comprehensive prediction pipeline, which includes the screening of the scaffold in publicly available natural compound databases. The screening algorithm was designed to detect homologous structures even for partial, incomplete clusters. The pipeline allows linking of gene clusters to known natural products and therefore also provides a metric to estimate the novelty of the cluster if a matching scaffold cannot be found. Whereas currently available tools attempt to provide comprehensive information about a wide range of gene clusters, SeMPI v2 aims to focus on precise predictions. Therefore, the cluster detection algorithm, including building block generation and domain substrate prediction, was thoroughly refined and benchmarked, to provide high-quality scaffold predictions. In a benchmark based on 559 gene clusters, SeMPI v2 achieved comparable or better results than antiSMASH v5. Additionally, the SeMPI v2 web server provides features that can help to further investigate a submitted gene cluster, such as the incorporation of a genome browser, and the possibility to modify a predicted scaffold in a workbench before the database screening.","title":"Sempi 2.0\u2014a web server for pks and nrps predictions combined with metabolite screening in natural product databases","authors":[{"name":"Zierep P.F."},{"name":"Ceci A.T."},{"name":"Dobrusin I."},{"name":"Rockwell-Kollmann S.C."},{"name":"Gunther S."}]},"pmid":"33383692","pmcid":"PMC7823522","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.3390/METABO11010013"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3744-189X","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Stefan GÃ¼nther","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"stefan.guenther@pharmazie.uni-freiburg.de","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"zsmag19","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:sempi","biotoolsID":"sempi","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-04-08T12:19:52Z","name":"SeMPI","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"},{"term":"Machine learning","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3474"},{"term":"Molecular modelling","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2275"}],"additionDate":"2021-03-19T08:35:01Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://sempi.pharmazie.uni-freiburg.de"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/SydneyBioX/hRUV"}],"description":"Hierarchical approach to removal of unwanted variation for large-scale metabolomics data.\n\nhRUV is a package for normalisation of multiple batches of metabolomics data in a hierarchical strategy with use of samples replicates in a large-scale studies.

Drug molecules can be metabolized into reactive metabolites, which can conjugate to biomolecules, like protein and DNA, in a process termed bioactivation. To mitigate adverse reactions caused by bioactivation, both experimental and computational screening assays are utilized. Experimental assays for assessing the formation of reactive metabolites are low throughput and expensive to perform, so they are often reserved until later stages of the drug development pipeline when the drug candidate pools are already significantly narrowed. In contrast, computational methods are high throughput and cheap to perform to screen thousands to millions of compounds for potentially toxic molecules during the early stages of the drug development pipeline. Commonly used computational methods focus on detecting and structurally characterizing reactive metabolite-biomolecule adducts or predicting sites on a drug molecule that are liable to form reactive metabolites. However, such methods are often only concerned with the structure of the initial drug molecule or of the adduct formed when a biomolecule conjugates to a reactive metabolite. Thus, these methods are likely to miss intermediate metabolites that may lead to subsequent reactive metabolite formation. To address these shortcomings, we create XenoNet, a metabolic network predictor, that can take a pair of a substrate and a target product as input and (1) enumerate pathways, or sequences of intermediate metabolite structures, between the pair, and (2) compute the likelihood of those pathways and intermediate metabolites. We validate XenoNet on a large, chemically diverse data set of 17 Â»054 metabolic networks built from a literature-derived reaction database. Each metabolic network has a defined substrate molecule that has been experimentally observed to undergo metabolism into a defined product metabolite. XenoNet can predict experimentally observed pathways and intermediate metabolites linking the input substrate and product pair with a recall of 88 and 46%, respectively. Using likelihood scoring, XenoNet also achieves a top-one pathway and intermediate metabolite accuracy of 93.6 and 51.9%, respectively.

The Worldwide Hydrobiogeochemistry Observation Network for Dynamic River Systems (WHONDRS) is a consortium that aims to understand complex hydrologic, biogeochemical, and microbial connections within river corridors experiencing perturbations such as dam operations, floods, and droughts. For one ongoing WHONDRS sampling campaign, surface water metabolite and microbiome samples are collected through a global survey to generate knowledge across diverse river corridors. Metabolomics analysis and a suite of geochemical analyses have been performed for collected samples through the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL). The obtained knowledge and data package inform mechanistic and data-driven models to enhance predictions of outcomes of hydrologic perturbations and watershed function, one of the most critical components in model-data integration. To support efforts of the multi-domain integration and make the ever-growing data package more accessible for researchers across the world, a Shiny/R Graphical User Interface (GUI) called WHONDRS-GUI was created. Results. The web application can be run on any modern web browser without any programming or operational system requirements, thus providing an open, well-structured, discoverable dataset for WHONDRS. Together with a context-aware dynamic user interface, the WHONDRS-GUI has functionality for searching, compiling, integrating, visualizing and exporting different data types that can easily be used by the community. The web application and data package are available at https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/view/doi:10.15485/1484811, which enables users to simultaneously obtain access to the data and code and to subsequently run the web app locally.

The omics data analysis by integration of biological knowledge with mathematical procedures implemented in the OmicsON R library is presented in the paper. OmicsON is a tool for the integration of two sets of data: transcriptomics and metabolomics. In the workflow of the library, the functional grouping and statistical analysis are applied. Subgroups among the transcriptomic and metabolomics sets are created based on the biological knowledge stored in Reactome and String databases. It gives the possibility to analyze such sets of data by multivariate statistical procedures like Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) or Partial Least Squares (PLS). The integration of metabolomic and transcriptomic data based on the methodology contained in OmicsON helps to easily obtain information on the connection of data from two different sets. This information can significantly help in assessing the relationship between gene expression and metabolite concentrations, which in turn facilitates the biological interpretation of the analyzed process.","title":"OmicsON - Integration of omics data with molecular networks and statistical procedures","authors":[{"name":"Turek C."},{"name":"Wrobel S."},{"name":"Piwowar M."}]},"pmid":"32726348","pmcid":"PMC7390260","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0235398"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4645-8730","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Monika Piwowar","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"mpiwowar@cm-uj.krakow.pl","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Niclaskn","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Library"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:omicson","biotoolsID":"omicson","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-03-13T19:08:14Z","name":"OmicsON","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Lipids","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0153"},{"term":"Transcriptomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3308"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Statistics and probability","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2269"}],"additionDate":"2021-01-18T10:05:26Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/cmujzbit/OmicsON"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Artificial intelligence approach to recognize off-sample mass spectrometry images.\n\nRecognizing off-sample mass spectrometry images with machine and deep learning.","language":["Python"],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"https://github.com/metaspace2020/metaspace/tree/master/metaspace/off-sample"}],"validated":0,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Natural product identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3803"},{"term":"Standardisation and normalisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3435"},{"term":"Spectrum calculation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3860"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","citationCount":12,"journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","abstract":"Â© 2020 The Author(s).Background: Imaging mass spectrometry (imaging MS) is an enabling technology for spatial metabolomics of tissue sections with rapidly growing areas of applications in biology and medicine. However, imaging MS data is polluted with off-sample ions caused by sample preparation, particularly by the MALDI (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization) matrix application. Off-sample ion images confound and hinder statistical analysis, metabolite identification and downstream analysis with no automated solutions available. Results: We developed an artificial intelligence approach to recognize off-sample ion images. First, we created a high-quality gold standard of 23,238 expert-tagged ion images from 87 public datasets from the METASPACE knowledge base. Next, we developed several machine and deep learning methods for recognizing off-sample ion images. The following methods were able to reproduce expert judgements with a high agreement: Residual deep learning (F1-score 0.97), semi-automated spatio-molecular biclustering (F1-score 0.96), and molecular co-localization (F1-score 0.90). In a test-case study, we investigated off-sample images corresponding to the most common MALDI matrix (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, DHB) and characterized properties of matrix clusters. Conclusions: Overall, our work illustrates how artificial intelligence approaches enabled by open-access data, web technologies, and machine and deep learning open novel avenues to address long-standing challenges in imaging MS.","title":"OffsampleAI: Artificial intelligence approach to recognize off-sample mass spectrometry images","authors":[{"name":"Ovchinnikova K."},{"name":"Kovalev V."},{"name":"Stuart L."},{"name":"Alexandrov T."}]},"pmid":"32245392","pmcid":"PMC7119286","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1186/S12859-020-3425-X"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9464-6125","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Theodore Alexandrov","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"theodore.alexandrov@embl.de","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Niclaskn","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:offsampleai","biotoolsID":"offsampleai","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-03-13T18:54:19Z","name":"OffsampleAI","topic":[{"term":"Machine learning","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3474"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Imaging","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3382"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Data mining","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3473"}],"additionDate":"2021-01-18T08:48:55Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/metaspace2020/offsample"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/mwang87/NP-Classifier"}],"description":"A Deep Neural Network-Based Structural Classification Tool for Natural Products.\n\nWe typitcally will deploy this locally.

Published by Oxford University Press.Nutrition research can be conducted by using two complementary approaches: (i) traditional self-reporting methods or (ii) via metabolomics techniques to analyze food intake biomarkers in biofluids. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of these two very different types of data often hinder their analysis and integration. To manage this challenge, we have developed a novel ontology that describes food and their associated metabolite entities in a hierarchical way. This ontology uses a formal naming system, category definitions, properties and relations between both types of data. The ontology presented is called FOBI (Food-Biomarker Ontology) and it is composed of two interconnected sub-ontologies. One is a 'Food Ontology' consisting of raw foods and 'multi-component foods' while the second is a 'Biomarker Ontology' containing food intake biomarkers classified by their chemical classes. These two sub-ontologies are conceptually independent but interconnected by different properties.

Numerous spider venom metabolites are uniquely found in spider venoms and are of interest concerning their potential use in pharmacology, agriculture, and cosmetics. A nontargeted ultra-high performance high-resolution electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HR-ESI-MS/MS) approach offers a resource-saving way for the analysis of crude spider venom. However, the identification of known as well as the structure elucidation of unknown low molecular mass spider venom compounds based on their MS/MS spectra is challenging because (1) acylpolyamine toxins are exclusively found in spider and wasp venom, (2) reference MS/MS spectra are missing in established mass spectrometry databases, and (3) trivial names for the various toxin metabolites are used in an inconsistent way in literature. Therefore, we introduce the freely accessible MS website for low molecular mass spider venom metabolites, venoMS, containing structural information, MS/MS spectra, and links to related literature. Currently the database contains the structures of 409 acylpolyamine toxins, 36 free linear polyamines, and 81 additional spider venom metabolites. Implemented into this website is a fragment ion calculator (FRIOC) that allows us to predict fragment ions of linear polyamine derivatives. With three metabolites from the venom of the spider Agelenopsis aperta, it was demonstrated how the new website can support the structural elucidation of acylpolyamines using their MS/MS spectra.","title":"VenoMS\u2014A website for the low molecular mass compounds in spider venoms","authors":[{"name":"Forster Y.M."},{"name":"Reusser S."},{"name":"Forster F."},{"name":"Bienz S."},{"name":"Bigler L."}]},"pmid":"32796671","pmcid":"PMC7464580","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.3390/METABO10080327"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3548-3594","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Laurent Bigler","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"laurent.bigler@chem.uzh.ch","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"zsmag19","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":[],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:venoms","biotoolsID":"venoms","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-03-11T10:33:03Z","name":"venoms","topic":[{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Literature and language","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3068"},{"term":"Taxonomy","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0637"}],"additionDate":"2021-01-18T10:37:11Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://www.venoms.ch"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Fluxer is a web application for the computation and interactive visualization of flux graphs from genome-scale metabolic models.

Ferroptosis is tightly linked to a variety of human diseases, such as cancers and degenerative diseases. The ferroptotic process is complicated and consists of a wide range of metabolites and biomolecules. Although great progress has been achieved, the mechanism of ferroptosis remains enigmatic. We have currently entered an era of extensive knowledge advancement, and thus, it is important to find ways to organize and utilize data efficiently. We have observed a high-quality knowledge base of ferroptosis research is lacking. In this study, we downloaded 784 ferroptosis articles from the PubMed database. Ferroptosis regulators and markers and associated diseases were extracted from these articles and annotated. In summary, 253 regulators (including 108 drivers, 69 suppressors, 35 inducers and 41 inhibitors), 111 markers and 95 ferroptosis-disease associations were found. We then developed FerrDb, the first manually curated database for regulators and markers of ferroptosis and ferroptosis-disease associations. The database has a user-friendly interface, and it will be updated every 6 months to offer long-term service. FerrDb is expected to help researchers acquire insights into ferroptosis.

Although the state-of-art modeling toolbox, COBRA 3.0, is powerful, it requires substantial computing time conducting flux balance analysis, knockout analysis, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, which may limit its application in large scale genome-wide analysis. Results: Here, we rewrote the underlying code of COBRA 3.0 using C/C++, and developed a toolbox, termed FastMM, to effectively conduct constraint-based metabolic modeling. The results showed that FastMM is 2~400 times faster than COBRA 3.0 in performing flux balance analysis and knockout analysis and returns consistent outputs. When applied to MCMC sampling, FastMM is 8 times faster than COBRA 3.0. FastMM is also faster than some efficient metabolic modeling applications, such as Cobrapy and Fast-SL. In addition, we developed a Matlab/Octave interface for fast metabolic modeling. This interface was fully compatible with COBRA 3.0, enabling users to easily perform complex applications for metabolic modeling. For example, users who do not have deep constraint-based metabolic model knowledge can just type one command in Matlab/Octave to perform personalized metabolic modeling. Users can also use the advance and multiple threading parameters for complex metabolic modeling. Thus, we provided an efficient and user-friendly solution to perform large scale genome-wide metabolic modeling. For example, FastMM can be applied to the modeling of individual cancer metabolic profiles of hundreds to thousands of samples in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Conclusion: FastMM is an efficient and user-friendly toolbox for large-scale personalized constraint-based metabolic modeling. It can serve as a complementary and invaluable improvement to the existing functionalities in COBRA 3.0.

For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.comMotivation: Microbial metabolic interactions impact ecosystems, human health and biotechnology profoundly. However, their determination remains elusive, invoking an urgent need for predictive models seamlessly integrating metabolism with evolutionary principles that shape community interactions. Results: Inspired by the evolutionary game theory, we formulated a bi-level optimization framework termed NECom for which any feasible solutions are Nash equilibria of microbial community metabolic models with/without an outer-level (community) objective function. Distinct from discrete matrix games, NECom models the continuous interdependent strategy space of metabolic fluxes. We showed that NECom successfully predicted several classical games in the context of metabolic interactions that were falsely or incompletely predicted by existing methods, including prisoner's dilemma, snowdrift and cooperation. The improved capability originates from the novel formulation to prevent 'forced altruism' hidden in previous static algorithms while allowing for sensing all potential metabolite exchanges to determine evolutionarily favorable interactions between members, a feature missing in dynamic methods. The results provided insights into why mutualism is favorable despite seemingly costly cross-feeding metabolites and demonstrated similarities and differences between games in the continuous metabolic flux space and matrix games. NECom was then applied to a reported algae-yeast co-culture system that shares typical cross-feeding features of lichen, a model system of mutualism. 488 growth conditions corresponding to 3221 experimental data points were simulated. Without training any parameters using the data, NECom is more predictive of species' growth rates given uptake rates compared with flux balance analysis with an overall 63.5% and 81.7% reduction in root-mean-square error for the two species respectively.","title":"Predicting Nash equilibria for microbial metabolic interactions","authors":[{"name":"Cai J."},{"name":"Tan T."},{"name":"Chan S.H.J."}]},"pmid":"33315094","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/BIOINFORMATICS/BTAA1014"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Tianwei Tan","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"Joshua.Chan@colostate.edu","url":null,"typeRole":[]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"S H Joshua Chan","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"twtan@mail.buct.edu.cn","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Niclaskn","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Script"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:necom","biotoolsID":"necom","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-03-08T13:11:48Z","name":"NECom","topic":[{"term":"Endocrinology and metabolism","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3407"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Biotechnology","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3297"},{"term":"Model organisms","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0621"}],"additionDate":"2021-01-18T12:35:51Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/Jingyi-Cai/NECom.git"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"ExpoKids is an R-based tool for characterizing aggregate chemical exposure during childhood.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41370-020-00265-6/MediaObjects/41370_2020_265_MOESM2_ESM.docx"}],"validated":0,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Aggregation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3436"},{"term":"Visualisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0337"},{"term":"Editing","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3096"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2021-03-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":0,"journal":"Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology","abstract":"Â© 2020, The Author(s).Background: Aggregate exposure, the combined exposures to a single chemical from all pathways, is a critical children\u2019s health issue.

Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Motivation: Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is a standard method for proteomics and metabolomics analysis of biological samples. Unfortunately, it suffers from various changes in the retention times (RT) of the same compound in different samples, and these must be subsequently corrected (aligned) during data processing. Classic alignment methods such as in the popular XCMS package often assume a single time-warping function for each sample. Thus, the potentially varying RT drift for compounds with different masses in a sample is neglected in these methods. Moreover, the systematic change in RT drift across run order is often not considered by alignment algorithms. Therefore, these methods cannot effectively correct all misalignments. For a large-scale experiment involving many samples, the existence of misalignment becomes inevitable and concerning. Results: Here, we describe an integrated reference-free profile alignment method, neighbor-wise compound-specific Graphical Time Warping (ncGTW), that can detect misaligned features and align profiles by leveraging expected RT drift structures and compound-specific warping functions. Specifically, ncGTW uses individualized warping functions for different compounds and assigns constraint edges on warping functions of neighboring samples. Validated with both realistic synthetic data and internal quality control samples, ncGTW applied to two large-scale metabolomics LC-MS datasets identifies many misaligned features and successfully realigns them. These features would otherwise be discarded or uncorrected using existing methods. The ncGTW software tool is developed currently as a plug-in to detect and realign misaligned features present in standard XCMS output.","title":"Targeted realignment of LC-MS profiles by neighbor-wise compound-specific graphical time warping with misalignment detection","authors":[{"name":"Wu C.-T."},{"name":"Wang Y."},{"name":"Wang Y."},{"name":"Ebbels T."},{"name":"Karaman I."},{"name":"Karaman I."},{"name":"Graca G."},{"name":"Pinto R."},{"name":"Pinto R."},{"name":"Herrington D.M."},{"name":"Wang Y."},{"name":"Yu G."}]},"pmid":"31950989","pmcid":"PMC7203744","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/BIOINFORMATICS/BTAA037"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"David M Herrington","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"dherring@wakehealth.edu","url":null,"typeRole":[]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Yue Wang","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"yuewang@vt.edu","url":null,"typeRole":[]},{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6743-7413","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Guoqiang Yu","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"yug@vt.edu","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Niclaskn","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Library"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ncgtw","biotoolsID":"ncgtw","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-03-08T09:45:54Z","name":"ncGTW","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Sequence analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0080"}],"additionDate":"2021-01-18T07:06:14Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/ChiungTingWu/ncGTW"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/escher-trace/escher-trace.github.io"}],"description":"Escher-Trace is an interactive pathway visualization tool for on-the-fly stable isotope tracing analysis.","language":["JavaScript"],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Pathway visualisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3926"},{"term":"Metabolic pathway prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3929"},{"term":"Dimethyl","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3642"},{"term":"Metabolic labeling","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3715"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2020-07-10T00:00:00Z","citationCount":3,"journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","abstract":"Â© 2020 The Author(s).Background: Stable isotope tracing has become an invaluable tool for probing the metabolism of biological systems.

Based on these reaction rules, a toxin biotransformation prediction model was constructed. Finally, the global chemical space of biogenic toxins was constructed, comprising ~550,000 toxins and putative toxin metabolites, of which 94.7% of the metabolites have not been previously reported. Additionally, we performed a case study to investigate citrinin metabolism in Trichoderma, and a novel metabolite was identified with the assistance of the biotransformation prediction tool of ToxinDB.

Similarly, basic scientists have valuable molecular cellular and animal data based on musculoskeletal disease that would be enhanced by being able to determine the human translation of their findings. By integrating these large-scale human genomic musculoskeletal datasets with complementary evidence from model organisms, new and existing genetic loci can be statistically fine-mapped to plausibly causal variants, candidate genes, and biological pathways. Genes and pathways identified using this approach can be further prioritized as drug targets, including side-effect profiling and the potential for new indications. To bring together these big data, and to realize the vision of creating a knowledge portal, the International Federation of Musculoskeletal Research Societies (IFMRS) established a working group to collaborate with scientists from the Broad Institute to create the Musculoskeletal Knowledge Portal (MSK-KP)(http://mskkp.org/).

Nevertheless, most studies focus on the final proteins identified through a suite of algorithms by using partial MS spectra to compare with the sequence database, while the pattern recognition and classification of raw mass-spectrometric data remain unresolved. Results: We developed an open-source and comprehensive platform, named MSpectraAI, for analyzing large-scale MS data through deep neural networks (DNNs); this system involves spectral-feature swath extraction, classification, and visualization. Moreover, this platform allows users to create their own DNN model by using Keras. To evaluate this tool, we collected the publicly available proteomics datasets of six tumor types (a total of 7,997,805 mass spectra) from the ProteomeXchange consortium and classified the samples based on the spectra profiling. The results suggest that MSpectraAI can distinguish different types of samples based on the fingerprint spectrum and achieve better prediction accuracy in MS1 level (average 0.967). Conclusion: This study deciphers proteome profiling of raw mass spectrometry data and broadens the promising application of the classification and prediction of proteomics data from multi-tumor samples using deep learning methods. MSpectraAI also shows a better performance compared to the other classical machine learning approaches.","title":"MSpectraAI: A powerful platform for deciphering proteome profiling of multi-tumor mass spectrometry data by using deep neural networks","authors":[{"name":"Wang S."},{"name":"Zhu H."},{"name":"Zhou H."},{"name":"Cheng J."},{"name":"Yang H."}]},"pmid":"33028193","pmcid":"PMC7539376","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1186/S12859-020-03783-0"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Jingqiu Cheng","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"jqcheng@scu.edu.cn","url":null,"typeRole":[]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Hao Yang","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"yanghao@scu.edu.cn","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Niclaskn","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"high","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":[],"license":"GPL-3.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mspectraai","biotoolsID":"mspectraai","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-03-01T09:56:55Z","name":"MSpectraAI","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Machine learning","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3474"},{"term":"Sequence analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0080"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"}],"additionDate":"2021-01-18T11:27:03Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/wangshisheng/MSpectraAI"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"A feature-filtering approach to improve annotation rate in untargeted LC-MS based metabolomics.\n\nMS-CleanR: A package for cleaning and annotating LC-MS data.\n\nThe MS-CleanR package provides functions for feature filtering and annotation of LC-MS data.\n\nMS-CleanR use as input MS-DIAL peak list processed in data dependent analysis (DDA) or data independent analysis (DIA) using either positive ionization mode (PI) or negative ionization mode (NI) or both.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Deisotoping","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3629"},{"term":"Filtering","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3695"},{"term":"Essential dynamics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3891"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":null,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1101/2020.04.09.033308"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Guillaume Marti","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"guillaume.marti@univ-tlse3.fr","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Niclaskn","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Library"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ms-cleanr","biotoolsID":"ms-cleanr","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-03-01T09:47:19Z","name":"MS-CleanR","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"},{"term":"Plant biology","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0780"}],"additionDate":"2021-01-18T08:36:33Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/eMetaboHUB/MS-CleanR"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Automated Data Processing for Large-Scale Targeted Metabolomics Analysis.\n\nMRMkit: automated data processing for large-scale targeted mass spectrometry.","language":["Python","R"],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Deisotoping","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3629"},{"term":"Quantification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3799"},{"term":"Peak detection","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3215"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2020-10-20T00:00:00Z","citationCount":1,"journal":"Analytical Chemistry","abstract":"Â© 2020 American Chemical Society.MRMkit is an open-source software package designed for automated processing of large-scale targeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics data.

A cohesive bioinformatics platform is thus urgently needed to aid in the functional determination of the remaining genes. Description: TeaCoN, a database of gene co-expression network for tea plant, was established to provide genome-wide associations in gene co-expression to survey gene modules (i.e., co-expressed gene sets) for a function of interest. TeaCoN featured a comprehensive collection of 261 high-quality RNA-Seq experiments that covered a wide range of tea tissues as well as various treatments for tea plant. In the current version of TeaCoN, 31,968 (94% coverage of the genome) tea gene models were documented. Users can retrieve detailed co-expression information for gene(s) of interest in four aspects: 1) co-expressed genes with the corresponding Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC-values) and statistical P-values, 2) gene information (gene ID, description, symbol, alias, chromosomal location, GO and KEGG annotation), 3) expression profile heatmap of co-expressed genes across seven main tea tissues (e.g., leaf, bud, stem, root), and 4) network visualization of co-expressed genes. We also implemented a gene co-expression analysis, BLAST search function, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, and genome browser to facilitate use of the database.

As a part of metabolomics and initially dedicated to identifying bioactive natural products, dereplication aims at reducing the usual time-consuming process of known compounds isolation. Mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance are the most commonly reported analytical tools during dereplication analysis. Though it has low sensitivity, 13C NMR has many advantages for such a study. Notably, it is nonspecific allowing simultaneous high-resolution analysis of any organic compounds including stereoisomers. Since NMR spectrometers nowadays provide useful data sets in a reasonable time frame, we have embarked upon writing software dedicated to 13C NMR dereplication. The present study describes the development of a freely distributed algorithm, namely MixONat and its ability to help researchers decipher complex mixtures. Based on Python 3.5, MixONat analyses a {1H}-13C NMR spectrum optionally combined with DEPT-135 and 90 data - to distinguish carbon types (i.e., CH3, CH2, CH, and C) - as well as a MW filtering. The software requires predicted or experimental carbon chemical shifts (Î´c) databases and displays results that can be refined based on user interactions. As a proof of concept, this 13C NMR dereplication strategy was evaluated on mixtures of increasing complexity and exhibiting pharmaceutical (poppy alkaloids), nutritional (rosemary extracts) or cosmetics (mangosteen peel extract) applications. Associated results were compared with other methods commonly used for dereplication. MixONat gave coherent results that rapidly oriented the user toward the correct structural types of secondary metabolites, allowing the user to distinguish between structurally close natural products, including stereoisomers.","title":"MixONat, a Software for the Dereplication of Mixtures Based on 13C NMR Spectroscopy","authors":[{"name":"Bruguiere A."},{"name":"Derbre S."},{"name":"Dietsch J."},{"name":"Leguy J."},{"name":"Rahier V."},{"name":"Pottier Q."},{"name":"Breard D."},{"name":"Suor-Cherer S."},{"name":"Viault G."},{"name":"Le Ray A.-M."},{"name":"Saubion F."},{"name":"Richomme P."}]},"pmid":"32479074","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/ACS.ANALCHEM.0C00193"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Niclaskn","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Library"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mixonat","biotoolsID":"mixonat","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-02-26T08:48:31Z","name":"MixONat","topic":[{"term":"NMR","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0593"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Nutritional science","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3390"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"}],"additionDate":"2021-01-18T09:40:30Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://sourceforge.net/projects/mixonat"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://GitHub.com/bhklab/SYNERGxDB"}],"description":"an integrative pharmacogenomic portal to identify synergistic drug combinations for precision oncology.","language":["JavaScript"],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Expression analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2495"},{"term":"Box-Whisker plot plotting","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2943"},{"term":"Database search","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2421"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":6,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","abstract":"Â© The Author(s) 2020.

Increasing number of researchers have researched mechanism, biomarkers and targeted drugs by metabolites. However, compared with our knowledge about genes, RNAs, and proteins, we still know few about diseases-related metabolites. All the few existed methods for identifying diseases-related metabolites ignore the chemical structure of metabolites, fail to recognize the association pattern between metabolites and diseases, and fail to apply to isolated diseases and metabolites. RESULTS: In this study, we present a graph deep learning based method, named Deep-DRM, for identifying diseases-related metabolites. First, chemical structures of metabolites were used to calculate similarities of metabolites. The similarities of diseases were obtained based on their functional gene network and semantic associations. Therefore, both metabolites and diseases network could be built. Next, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) was applied to encode the features of metabolites and diseases, respectively. Then, the dimension of these features was reduced by Principal components analysis (PCA) with retainment 99% information. Finally, Deep neural network was built for identifying true metabolite-disease pairs (MDPs) based on these features. The 10-cross validations on three testing setups showed outstanding AUC (0.952) and AUPR (0.939) of Deep-DRM compared with previous methods and similar approaches. Ten of top 15 predicted associations between diseases and metabolites got support by other studies, which suggests that Deep-DRM is an efficient method to identify MDPs.

In the field of metabolomics research, this issue has largely remained unaddressed; MS signal intensities are usually directly used to calculate fold changes for quantitative comparison. In this work, we demonstrate that, due to the nonlinear ESI response, signal intensity ratios of a metabolic feature calculated between two samples may not reflect their real metabolic concentration ratios (i.e., fold-change compression), implying that conventional fold-change calculations directly using MS signal intensities can be misleading. In this regard, we developed a quality control (QC) sample-based signal calibration workflow to overcome the quantitative bias caused by the nonlinear ESI response. In this workflow, calibration curves for every metabolic feature are first established using a QC sample injected in serial injection volumes. The MS signals of each metabolic feature are then calibrated to their equivalent QC injection volumes for comparative analysis. We demonstrated this novel workflow in a targeted metabolite analysis, showing that the accuracy of fold-change calculations can be significantly improved.

Struct integrates with the STATistics Ontology to ensure consistent reporting and maximizes semantic interoperability. We also present a toolbox, named structToolbox, which includes an extensive set of commonly used data analysis methods that have been implemented using struct.

Researchers, without coding, can interactively visualize and evaluate data in the context of its metadata, honing-in on groups of samples or genes based on attributes such as expression values, statistical associations, metadata terms and ontology annotations. Interaction with data is easy via interactive visualizations such as line charts, box plots, scatter plots, histograms and volcano plots. Statistical analyses include co-expression analysis, differential expression analysis and differential correlation analysis, with significance tests. Researchers can send data subsets to R for additional analyses. Multithreading and indexing enable efficient big data analysis. A researcher can create new MOG projects from any numerical data; or explore an existing MOG project. MOG projects, with history of explorations, can be saved and shared. We illustrate MOG by case studies of large curated datasets from human cancer RNA-Seq, where we identify novel putative biomarker genes in different tumors, and microarray and metabolomics data from Arabidopsis thaliana.

As a result, the output of these pre-processing software may retain incorrectly calculated metabolite abundances that can perpetuate in downstream analyses. Objectives: To address this problem, we propose a computational methodology that combines machine learning and peak quality metrics to filter out low quality peaks. Methods: Specifically, we comprehensively and systematically compared the performance of 24 different classifiers generated by combining eight classification algorithms and three sets of peak quality metrics on the task of distinguishing reliably integrated peaks from poorly integrated ones. These classifiers were compared to using a residual standard deviation (RSD) cut-off in pooled quality-control (QC) samples, which aims to remove peaks with analytical error. Results: The best performing classifier was found to be a combination of the AdaBoost algorithm and a set of 11 peak quality metrics previously explored in untargeted metabolomics and proteomics studies. As a complementary approach, applying our framework to peaks retained after filtering by 30% RSD across pooled QC samples was able to further distinguish poorly integrated peaks that were not removed from filtering alone. An R implementation of these classifiers and the overall computational approach is available as the MetaClean package at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MetaClean.

Published by Oxford University Press.MOTIVATION: Many diseases have a metabolic background, which is increasingly investigated due to improved measurement techniques allowing high-throughput assessment of metabolic features in several body fluids. Integrating data from multiple cohorts is of high importance to obtain robust and reproducible results. However, considerable variability across studies due to differences in sampling, measurement techniques and study populations needs to be accounted for. RESULTS: We present Metabolite-Investigator, a scalable analysis workflow for quantitative metabolomics data from multiple studies. Our tool supports all aspects of data pre-processing including data integration, cleaning, transformation, batch analysis as well as multiple analysis methods including uni- and multivariable factor-metabolite associations, network analysis and factor prioritization in one or more cohorts. Moreover, it allows identifying critical interactions between cohorts and factors affecting metabolite levels and inferring a common covariate model, all via a graphical user interface.

These algorithms require identification of a list of high confidence (core) reactions from transcriptomics, but parameters related to identification of core reactions, such as thresholding of expression profiles, can significantly change model content. Importantly, current thresholding approaches are burdened with setting singular arbitrary thresholds for all genes; thus, resulting in removal of enzymes needed in small amounts and even many housekeeping genes. Here, we describe StanDep, a novel heuristic method for using transcriptomics to identify core reactions prior to building contextspecific metabolic models. StanDep clusters gene expression data based on their expression pattern across different contexts and determines thresholds for each cluster using data-dependent statistics, specifically standard deviation and mean. To demonstrate the use of StanDep, we built hundreds of models for the NCI-60 cancer cell lines. These models successfully increased the inclusion of housekeeping reactions, which are often lost in models built using standard thresholding approaches. Further, StanDep also provided a transcriptomic explanation for inclusion of lowly expressed reactions that were otherwise only supported by model extraction methods. Our study also provides novel insights into how cells may deal with context-specific and ubiquitous functions.","title":"StanDep: Capturing transcriptomic variability improves context-specific metabolic models","authors":[{"name":"Joshi C.J."},{"name":"Schinn S.-M."},{"name":"Richelle A."},{"name":"Shamie I."},{"name":"O'Rourke E.J."},{"name":"Lewis N.E."}]},"pmid":"32396573","pmcid":"PMC7244210","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1371/JOURNAL.PCBI.1007764"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7700-3654","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Nathan E.

Most computational tools to identify tandem mass spectra focus on a limited set of molecules of interest. However, such tools are typically constrained by the availability of reference spectra or molecular databases, limiting their applicability of generating structural hypotheses for unknown metabolites. In contrast, recent advances in the field illustrate the possibility to expose the underlying biochemistry without relying on metabolite identification, in particular via substructure prediction. We describe an automated method for substructure recommendation motivated by association rule mining. Our framework captures potential relationships between spectral features and substructures learned from public spectral libraries. These associations are used to recommend substructures for any unknown mass spectrum. Our method does not require any predefined metabolite candidates, and therefore it can be used for the hypothesis generation or partial identification of unknown unknowns.

In constraint-based reconstruction and analysis of metabolic networks, this uncertainty is present both during the reconstruction of networks and in simulations performed with them. Here, we present Medusa, a Python package for the generation and analysis of ensembles of genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions. Medusa builds on the COBRApy package for constraint-based reconstruction and analysis by compressing a set of models into a compact ensemble object, providing functions for the generation of ensembles using experimental data, and extending constraint-based analyses to ensemble scale. We demonstrate how Medusa can be used to generate ensembles and perform ensemble simulations, and how machine learning can be used in conjunction with Medusa to guide the curation of genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions.

Several specificity metrics have been introduced to identify tissue-specific molecular features, but these either require an equal number of replicates per tissue or they can't handle replicates at all. Results: We describe a non-parametric specificity score that is compatible with unequal sample group sizes. To demonstrate its usefulness, the specificity score was calculated on all GTEx samples, detecting known and novel tissue-specific genes. A webtool was developed to browse these results for genes or tissues of interest. An example python implementation of SPECS is available at https://github.com/celineeveraert/SPECS. The precalculated SPECS results on the GTEx data are available through a user-friendly browser at specs.cmgg.be.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Significant advancements in the field of protein structure prediction have necessitated the need for objective and robust evaluation of protein structural models by comparing predicted models against the experimentally determined native structures to quantitate their structural similarities. Existing protein model versus native similarity metrics either consider the distances between alpha carbon (CÎ±) or side-chain atoms for computing the similarity. However, side-chain orientation of a protein plays a critical role in defining its conformation at the atomic-level. Despite its importance, inclusion of side-chain orientation in structural similarity evaluation has not yet been addressed. Here, we present SPECS, a side-chain-orientation-included protein model-native similarity metric for improved evaluation of protein structural models. SPECS combines side-chain orientation and global distance based measures in an integrated framework using the united-residue model of polypeptide conformation for computing model-native similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that SPECS is a reliable measure for evaluating structural similarity at the global level including and beyond the accuracy of CÎ± positioning. Moreover, SPECS delivers superior performance in capturing local quality aspect compared to popular global CÎ± positioning-based metrics ranging from models at near-experimental accuracies to models with correct overall folds\u2014making it a robust measure suitable for both high- and moderate-resolution models. Finally, SPECS is sensitive to minute variations in side-chain Ï angles even for models with perfect CÎ± trace, revealing the power of including side-chain orientation. Collectively, SPECS is a versatile evaluation metric covering a wide spectrum of protein modeling scenarios and simultaneously captures complementary aspects of structural similarities at multiple levels of granularities.

However, analyzing the resulting multi-omics data and their correlations remains a significant challenge due to the lack of a comprehensive computational tool that can facilitate data integration and interpretation. In this study, an automated microbiome and metabolome integrative analysis pipeline (M2IA) has been developed to meet the urgent needs for tools that can effectively integrate microbiome and metabolome data to derive biological insights. Results: M2IA streamlines the integrative data analysis between metabolome and microbiome, from data preprocessing, univariate and multivariate statistical analyses, advanced functional analysis for biological interpretation, to a summary report. The functionality of M2IA was demonstrated using TwinsUK cohort datasets consisting of 1116 fecal metabolites and 16s rRNA microbiome from 786 individuals. Moreover, two important metabolic pathways, i.e. benzoate degradation and phosphotransferase system, were identified to be closely associated with obesity.

Most modern NMR spectrometers are now equipped with auto-tune/auto-match probes along with automated locking and shimming systems. Likewise, more and more instruments, especially for NMR-based metabolomics applications, are equipped with automated sample changers. All this instrumental automation allows NMR data to be collected at a rate of &gt;100 samples/day. However, a continuing bottleneck in NMR-based metabolomics has been the time required to manually analyze and annotate the collected NMR spectra. In many cases, manual spectral annotation and analysis can take one or more hours per spectrum. Fortunately, over the past few years, several software tools have been developed that largely automate the spectral deconvolution or spectral annotation process. Using these tools requires that the samples must be prepared and the NMR spectra must be acquired in a very specific manner. In this chapter, we will describe the step-by-step preparation of biofluid samples along with the required protocols for acquiring optimal spectra for automated NMR metabolomics analysis. We will also discuss the use of three common tools (Chenomx NMR Suite, Bayesil, and COLMARm) for (semi-) automated profiling, and annotation of 1D- and 2D-NMR spectra of biofluids.","title":"Automated Tools for the Analysis of 1D-NMR and 2D-NMR Spectra","authors":[{"name":"Lipfert M."},{"name":"Rout M.K."},{"name":"Berjanskii M."},{"name":"Wishart D.S."}]},"pmid":"31463859","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1007/978-1-4939-9690-2_24"},{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","citationCount":3,"journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","abstract":"Copyright Â© 2020 American Chemical Society.Accurate identification of lipids in biological samples is a key step in lipidomics studies. Multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful analytical tool for this purpose as it provides comprehensive structural information on lipid composition at atomic resolution. However, the interpretation of NMR spectra of complex lipid mixtures is currently hampered by limited spectral resolution and the absence of a customized lipid NMR database along with user-friendly spectral analysis tools. We introduce a new two-dimensional (2D) NMR metabolite database \"COLMAR Lipids\" that was specifically curated for hydrophobic metabolites presently containing 501 compounds with accurate experimental 2D 13C-1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) chemical shift data measured in CDCl3. A new module in the public COLMAR suite of NMR web servers was developed for the (semi)automated analysis of complex lipidomics mixtures (http://spin.ccic.osu.edu/index.php/colmarm/index2). To obtain 2D HSQC spectra with the necessary high spectral resolution along both 13C and 1H dimensions, nonuniform sampling in combination with pure shift spectroscopy was applied allowing the extraction of an abundance of unique cross-peaks belonging to hydrophobic compounds in complex lipidomics mixtures. As shown here, this information is critical for the unambiguous identification of underlying lipid molecules by means of the new COLMAR Lipids web server, also in combination with mass spectrometry, as is demonstrated for Caco-2 cell and lung tissue cell extracts.","title":"COLMAR Lipids Web Server and Ultrahigh-Resolution Methods for Two-Dimensional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance- And Mass Spectrometry-Based Lipidomics","authors":[{"name":"Wang C."},{"name":"Timari I."},{"name":"Zhang B."},{"name":"Li D.-W."},{"name":"Leggett A."},{"name":"Amer A.O."},{"name":"Bruschweiler-Li L."},{"name":"Kopec R.E."},{"name":"Bruschweiler R."}]},"pmid":"32073269","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/ACS.JPROTEOME.9B00845"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[],"editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"owner":"Pub2Tools","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:COLMARm","biotoolsID":"COLMARm","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-02-17T08:42:02Z","name":"COLMARm","topic":[{"term":"NMR","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0593"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"MRI","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3444"}],"additionDate":"2019-11-14T18:33:15Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://spin.ccic.ohio-state.edu/index.php/colmarm/index"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://pypi.org/project/liputils/"}],"description":"A Python module to manage individual fatty acid moieties from complex lipids.\n\nA small Python package to manipulate complex lipids.","language":["Python"],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Parsing","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_1812"},{"term":"Essential dynamics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3891"},{"term":"Data retrieval","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2422"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2020-12-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":0,"journal":"Scientific Reports","abstract":"Â© 2020, The Author(s).Lipidomic analyses address the problem of characterizing the lipid components of given cells, tissues and organisms by means of chromatographic separations coupled to high-resolution, tandem mass spectrometry analyses.

Cluster Of Clusters Analysis (COCA) is one such approach that has been widely applied in the context of tumour subtyping. However, the properties of COCA have never been systematically explored, and its robustness to the inclusion of noisy datasets is unclear. Results: We rigorously benchmark COCA, and present Kernel Learning Integrative Clustering (KLIC) as an alternative strategy. KLIC frames the challenge of combining clustering structures as a multiple kernel learning problem, in which different datasets each provide a weighted contribution to the final clustering. This allows the contribution of noisy datasets to be down-weighted relative to more informative datasets. We compare the performances of KLIC and COCA in a variety of situations through simulation studies. We also present the output of KLIC and COCA in real data applications to cancer subtyping and transcriptional module discovery.","title":"Multiple kernel learning for integrative consensus clustering of omic datasets","authors":[{"name":"Cabassi A."},{"name":"Kirk P.D.W."}]},"pmid":"32592464","pmcid":"PMC7750932","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/BIOINFORMATICS/BTAA593"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5931-7489","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Paul D W Kirk","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"paul.kirk@mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Niclaskn","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":"MIT","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:klic","biotoolsID":"klic","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-02-12T10:40:22Z","name":"KLIC","topic":[{"term":"Machine learning","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3474"},{"term":"Gene expression","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0203"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Epigenomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3173"},{"term":"ChIP-on-chip","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3179"}],"additionDate":"2021-01-18T09:40:37Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/acabassi/klic-pancancer-analysis"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Multi-resolution characterization of molecular taxonomies in bulk and single-cell transcriptomics data.\n\nK2Taxonomer is an R package built around a \"top-down\" recursive partitioning framework to perform unsupervised learning of nested \u201ctaxonomy-like\u201d subgroups from high-throughput -omics data.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Metabolomics is increasingly important for biomedical research, but large-scale metabolite identification in untargeted metabolomics is still challenging. Here, we present Jumbo Mass spectrometry-based Program of Metabolomics (JUMPm) software, a streamlined software tool for identifying potential metabolite formulas and structures in mass spectrometry. During database search, the false discovery rate is evaluated by a target-decoy strategy, where the decoys are produced by breaking the octet rule of chemistry. We illustrated the utility of JUMPm by detecting metabolite formulas and structures from liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses of unlabeled and stable-isotope labeled yeast samples. We also benchmarked the performance of JUMPm by analyzing a mixed sample from a commercially available metabolite library in both hydrophilic and hydrophobic LC-MS/MS. These analyses confirm that metabolite identification can be significantly improved by estimating the element composition in formulas using stable isotope labeling, or by introducing LC retention time during a spectral library search, which are incorporated into JUMPm functions. Finally, we compared the performance of JUMPm and two commonly used programs, Compound Discoverer 3.1 and MZmine 2, with respect to putative metabolite identifications. Our results indicate that JUMPm is an effective tool for metabolite identification of both unlabeled and labeled data in untargeted metabolomics.","title":"JUMPm: A tool for large-scale identification of metabolites in untargeted metabolomics","authors":[{"name":"Wang X."},{"name":"Cho J.-H."},{"name":"Poudel S."},{"name":"Li Y."},{"name":"Jones D.R."},{"name":"Shaw T.I."},{"name":"Tan H."},{"name":"Xie B."},{"name":"Peng J."}]},"pmid":"32408578","pmcid":"PMC7281133","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.3390/METABO10050190"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Xusheng Wang","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"xusheng.wang@und.edu","url":null,"typeRole":[]},{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0472-7648","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Junmin Peng","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"junmin.peng@stjude.org","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Niclaskn","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:jumpm","biotoolsID":"jumpm","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-02-12T10:11:17Z","name":"JUMPm","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"},{"term":"Model organisms","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0621"},{"term":"Chemistry","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3314"}],"additionDate":"2021-01-18T09:03:56Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://www.stjuderesearch.org/site/lab/peng/jumpm"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Large enhancement of multi-omics data resources on the general Japanese population.\n\njMorp: Japanese Multi Omics Reference Panel - Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization, Tohoku University.","language":[],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"De-novo assembly","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0524"},{"term":"de Novo sequencing","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3644"},{"term":"Genotyping","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3196"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2021-01-08T00:00:00Z","citationCount":5,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","abstract":"Â© The Author(s) 2020.

For genomic data, jMorp provides a Japanese reference sequence obtained using de novo assembly of sequences from three Japanese individuals and allele frequencies obtained using whole-genome sequencing of 8,380 Japanese individuals. In addition, the omics data include methylome and transcriptome data from â¼300 samples and distribution of concentrations of more than 755 metabolites obtained using high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance and high-sensitivity mass spectrometry. In summary, jMorp now provides four different kinds of omics data (genome, methylome, transcriptome, and metabolome), with a user-friendly web interface.

Ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) provides rapid two-dimensional separation of ions based on their mobility through a neutral buffer gas. The mobility of an ion is related to its collision cross section (CCS) with the buffer gas, a physical property that is determined by the size and shape of the ion. This structural dependency makes CCS a promising characteristic for compound identification, but this utility is limited by the availability of high-quality reference CCS values. CCS prediction using machine learning (ML) has recently shown promise in the field, but accurate and broadly applicable models are still lacking. Here we present a novel ML approach that employs a comprehensive collection of CCS values covering a wide range of chemical space. Using this diverse database, we identified the structural characteristics, represented by molecular quantum numbers (MQNs), that contribute to variance in CCS and assessed the performance of a variety of ML algorithms in predicting CCS. We found that by breaking down the chemical structural diversity using unsupervised clustering based on the MQNs, specific and accurate prediction models for each cluster can be trained, which showed superior performance than a single model trained with all data. Using this approach, we have robustly trained and characterized a CCS prediction model with high accuracy on diverse chemical structures.

Studies frequently rely on a single urinary measurement per participant to assess exposure to non-persistent chemicals. However, there is a growing consensus that single urine samples may be insufficient for adequately estimating exposure. The question then arises: how many samples would be needed for optimal characterization of exposure? To help researchers answer this question, we developed a tool called the Biomarker Reliability Assessment Tool (BRAT). The BRAT is based on pharmacokinetic modeling simulations, is freely available, and is designed to help researchers determine the approximate number of urine samples needed to optimize exposure assessment. The BRAT performs Monte Carlo simulations of exposure to estimate internal levels and resulting urinary concentrations in individuals from a population based on user-specified inputs (e.g., biological half-life, within-and between-person variability in exposure). The BRAT evaluates\u2014through linear regression and quantile classification\u2014the precision/accuracy of the estimation of internal levels depending on the number of urine samples.

Confidence in peak annotations increases by combining MS/MS matching and retention time. We here show how retention times can be predicted from molecular structures. Two large, publicly available data sets were used for model training in machine learning: the Fiehn hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography data set (HILIC) of 981 primary metabolites and biogenic amines,and the RIKEN plant specialized metabolome annotation (PlaSMA) database of 852 secondary metabolites that uses reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). Five different machine learning algorithms have been integrated into the Retip R package: the random forest, Bayesian-regularized neural network, XGBoost, light gradient-boosting machine (LightGBM), and Keras algorithms for building the retention time prediction models. A complete workflow for retention time prediction was developed in R. It can be freely downloaded from the GitHub repository (https://www.retip.app). Keras outperformed other machine learning algorithms in the test set with minimum overfitting, verified by small error differences between training, test, and validation sets. Keras yielded a mean absolute error of 0.78 min for HILIC and 0.57 min for RPLC. Retip is integrated into the mass spectrometry software tools MS-DIAL and MS-FINDER, allowing a complete compound annotation workflow. In a test application on mouse blood plasma samples, we found a 68% reduction in the number of candidate structures when searching all isomers in MS-FINDER compound identification software. Retention time prediction increases the identification rate in liquid chromatography and subsequently leads to an improved biological interpretation of metabolomics data.","title":"Retip: Retention Time Prediction for Compound Annotation in Untargeted Metabolomics","authors":[{"name":"Bonini P."},{"name":"Kind T."},{"name":"Tsugawa H."},{"name":"Barupal D.K."},{"name":"Fiehn O."}]},"pmid":"32390414","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/ACS.ANALCHEM.9B05765"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"zsmag19","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":[],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:retip","biotoolsID":"retip","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-02-06T13:53:15Z","name":"Retip","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Machine learning","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3474"},{"term":"Cheminformatics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2258"},{"term":"Chemistry","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3314"}],"additionDate":"2021-01-18T09:01:58Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://www.retip.app"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"An integrated platform for mass spectrometry-based metabolomics data mining.\n\nBACKGROUND:Metabolomics data analyses rely on the use of bioinformatics tools.

The IP4M, has 62 functions categorized into 8 modules, covering all the steps of metabolomics data mining, including raw data preprocessing (alignment, peak de-convolution, peak picking, and isotope filtering), peak annotation, peak table preprocessing, basic statistical description, classification and biomarker detection, correlation analysis, cluster and sub-cluster analysis, regression analysis, ROC analysis, pathway and enrichment analysis, and sample size and power analysis. Additionally, a KEGG-derived metabolic reaction database was embedded and a series of ratio variables (product/substrate) can be generated with enlarged information on enzyme activity. A new method, GRaMM, for correlation analysis between metabolome and microbiome data was also provided. IP4M provides both a number of parameters for customized and refined analysis (for expert users), as well as 4 simplified workflows with few key parameters (for beginners who are unfamiliar with computational metabolomics). The performance of IP4M was evaluated and compared with existing computational platforms using 2 data sets derived from standards mixture and 2 data sets derived from serum samples, from GC-MS and LC-MS respectively. Conclusion: IP4M is powerful, modularized, customizable and easy-to-use. It is a good choice for metabolomics data processing and analysis.

NMR spectroscopy is unique among biophysical approaches in its ability to provide a broad range of atomic and higher-level information relevant to the structural, dynamic, and chemical properties of biological macromolecules, as well as report on metabolite and natural product concentrations in complex mixtures and their chemical structures. BMRB became a core member of the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) in 2007, and the BMRB archive is now a core archive of the wwPDB. Currently, about 10% of the structures deposited into the PDB archive are based on NMR spectroscopy. BMRB stores experimental and derived data from biomolecular NMR studies. Newer BMRB biopolymer depositions are divided about evenly between those associated with structure determinations (atomic coordinates and supporting information archived in the PDB) and those reporting experimental information on molecular dynamics, conformational transitions, ligand binding, assigned chemical shifts, or other results from NMR spectroscopy. BMRB also provides resources for NMR studies of metabolites and other small molecules that are often macromolecular ligands and/or nonstandard residues. This chapter is directed to the structural biology community rather than the metabolomics and natural products community. Our goal is to describe various BMRB services offered to structural biology researchers and how they can be accessed and utilized. These services can be classified into four main groups: (1) data deposition, (2) data retrieval, (3) data analysis, and (4) services for NMR spectroscopists and software developers. The chapter also describes the NMR-STAR data format used by BMRB and the tools provided to facilitate its use. For programmers, BMRB offers an application programming interface (API) and libraries in the Python and R languages that enable users to develop their own BMRB-based tools for data analysis, visualization, and manipulation of NMR-STAR formatted files. BMRB also provides users with direct access tools through the NMRbox platform.","title":"BioMagResBank (BMRB) as a Resource for Structural Biology","authors":[{"name":"Romero P.R."},{"name":"Kobayashi N."},{"name":"Wedell J.R."},{"name":"Baskaran K."},{"name":"Iwata T."},{"name":"Yokochi M."},{"name":"Maziuk D."},{"name":"Yao H."},{"name":"Fujiwara T."},{"name":"Kurusu G."},{"name":"Ulrich E.L."},{"name":"Hoch J.C."},{"name":"Markley J.L."}]},"pmid":"32006287","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1007/978-1-0716-0270-6_14"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"jmarkley@wisc.edu","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Kigaard","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Database portal"],"license":"GPL-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:bmrb","biotoolsID":"bmrb","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-02-04T16:32:15Z","name":"BMRB","topic":[{"term":"NMR","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0593"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Biophysics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3306"},{"term":"Chemistry","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3314"}],"additionDate":"2021-01-18T07:38:36Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/bioaster/biotracs-m-spectra"},{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/bioaster/biotracs-papers"}],"description":"BioTracs is a transversal framework for computational workflow standardization and traceability.

To demonstrate this, chespa currently streamlines prediction of various molecular descriptors (predicted chemical properties, molecular substructures, AI-based chemical space, and chemical class ontology) in order to test six different chemical space definitions. Furthermore, we investigated how these varying definitions trend with mass spectrometry (MS)-based observability, that is, the ability of a molecule to be observed with MS (e.g., as a function of the molecule ionizability), using an example data set from the U.S. EPA's nontargeted analysis collaborative trial, where blinded samples had been analyzed previously, providing 1398 data points. Improved understanding of observability would offer many advantages in small-molecule identification, such as (i) a priori selection of experimental conditions based on suspected sample composition, (ii) the ability to reduce the number of candidate structures during compound identification by removing those less likely to ionize, and, in turn, (iii) a reduced false discovery rate and increased confidence in identifications. Factors controlling observability are not fully understood, making prediction of this property nontrivial and a prime candidate for chemical space analysis.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Motivation: Untargeted metabolomics comprehensively characterizes small molecules and elucidates activities of biochemical pathways within a biological sample. Despite computational advances, interpreting collected measurements and determining their biological role remains a challenge. Results: To interpret measurements, we present an inference-based approach, termed Probabilistic modeling for Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis (PUMA). Our approach captures metabolomics measurements and the biological network for the biological sample under study in a generative model and uses stochastic sampling to compute posterior probability distributions. PUMA predicts the likelihood of pathways being active, and then derives probabilistic annotations, which assign chemical identities to measurements. Unlike prior pathway analysis tools that analyze differentially active pathways, PUMA defines a pathway as active if the likelihood that the path generated the observed measurements is above a particular (user-defined) threshold. Due to the lack of \u201cground truth\u201d metabolomics datasets, where all measurements are annotated and pathway activities are known, PUMA is validated on synthetic datasets that are designed to mimic cellular processes. PUMA, on average, outperforms pathway enrichment analysis by 8%. PUMA is applied to two case studies. PUMA suggests many biological meaningful pathways as active. Annotation results were in agreement to those obtained using other tools that utilize additional information in the form of spectral signatures.

Due to technical limitations of the Liquid Chromatography\u2013Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) platform, samples often need to be processed in multiple batches. Across different batches, we often observe differences in data characteristics. In this work, we specifically focus on data generated in multiple batches on the same LC/MS machinery. Traditional preprocessing methods treat all samples as a single group. Such practice can result in errors in the alignment of peaks, which cannot be corrected by post hoc application of batch effect correction methods. In this work, we developed a new approach that address the batch effect issue in the preprocessing stage, resulting in better peak detection, alignment and quantification. It can be combined with down-stream batch effect correction methods to further correct for between-batch intensity differences. The method is implemented in the existing workflow of the apLCMS platform. Analyzing data with multiple batches, both generated from standardized quality control (QC) plasma samples and from real biological studies, the new method resulted in feature tables with better consistency, as well as better down-stream analysis results. The method can be a useful addition to the tools available for large studies involving multiple batches. The method is available as part of the apLCMS package.

While targeted workflows require previous knowledge of metabolites, prior to statistical analysis, untargeted approaches remain a challenge. Computational tools dealing with fully untargeted NMR-based metabolomics are still scarce or not user-friendly. Therefore, we developed AlpsNMR (Automated spectraL Processing System for NMR), an R package that provides automated and efficient signal processing for untargeted NMR metabolomics. AlpsNMR includes spectra loading, metadata handling, automated outlier detection, spectra alignment and peak-picking, integration and normalization. The resulting output can be used for further statistical analysis. AlpsNMR proved effective in detecting metabolite changes in a test case.

All rights reserved.Predicting the structures of metabolites formed in humans can provide advantageous insights for the development of drugs and other compounds. Here we present GLORYx, which integrates machine learning-based site of metabolism (SoM) prediction with reaction rule sets to predict and rank the structures of metabolites that could potentially be formed by phase 1 and/or phase 2 metabolism. GLORYx extends the approach from our previously developed tool GLORY, which predicted metabolite structures for cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism only. A robust approach to ranking the predicted metabolites is attained by using the SoM probabilities predicted by the FAME 3 machine learning models to score the predicted metabolites. On a manually curated test data set containing both phase 1 and phase 2 metabolites, GLORYx achieves a recall of 77% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.79. Separate analysis of performance on a large amount of freely available phase 1 and phase 2 metabolite data indicates that achieving a meaningful ranking of predicted metabolites is more difficult for phase 2 than for phase 1 metabolites. GLORYx is freely available as a web server at https://nerdd.zbh.uni-hamburg.de/ and is also provided as a software package upon request.

This large collection of data enables the exploration of molecular network responses to space environments using a systems biology approach.

We discuss our design for GEODE, particularly how it promotes investigators providing more accurate metadata, reducing the curation effort required of GeneLab staff. We also introduce here a new GeneLab Application Programming Interface (API) specifically designed to support tools for the visualization of processed omics data. We review the outreach efforts by GeneLab to utilize the spaceflight data in the repository to generate novel discoveries and develop new hypotheses, including spearheading data analysis working groups, and a high school student training program.

On the other hand, the preferred host organisms may not have the native metabolic reactions needed to produce the compound of interest; thus, the computational tool needs to identify the metabolic reactions that will most efficiently produce the desired product. In this regard, we developed the generic tool PATHcre8 to facilitate an optimized search for heterologous biosynthetic pathway routes. PATHcre8 finds and ranks biosynthesis routes in a large number of organisms, including Cyanobacteria. The tool ranks the pathways based on feature scores that reflect reaction thermodynamics, the potentially toxic products in the pathway (compound toxicity), intermediate products in the pathway consumed by competing reactions (product consumption), and host-specific information such as enzyme copy number. A comparison with several other similar tools shows that PATHcre8 is more efficient in ranking functional pathways. To illustrate the effectiveness of PATHcre8, we further provide case studies focused on isoprene production and the biodegradation of cocaine.

Here, we apply the tree-based pipeline optimization tool (TPOT) to predict angiographic diagnoses of coronary artery disease (CAD). With TPOT, ML models are represented as expression trees and optimal pipelines discovered using a stochastic search method called genetic programing. We provide some guidelines for TPOT-based ML pipeline selection and optimization-based on various clinical phenotypes and high-throughput metabolic profiles in the Angiography and Genes Study (ANGES). Results: We analyzed nuclear magnetic resonance-derived lipoprotein and metabolite profiles in the ANGES cohort with a goal to identify the role of non-obstructive CAD patients in CAD diagnostics. We performed a comparative analysis of TPOT-generated ML pipelines with selected ML classifiers, optimized with a grid search approach, applied to two phenotypic CAD profiles. As a result, TPOT-generated ML pipelines that outperformed grid search optimized models across multiple performance metrics including balanced accuracy and area under the precision-recall curve. With the selected models, we demonstrated that the phenotypic profile that distinguishes non-obstructive CAD patients from no CAD patients is associated with higher precision, suggesting a discrepancy in the underlying processes between these phenotypes.","title":"Model selection for metabolomics: Predicting diagnosis of coronary artery disease using automated machine learning","authors":[{"name":"Orlenko A."},{"name":"Kofink D."},{"name":"Lyytikainen L.-P."},{"name":"Nikus K."},{"name":"Mishra P."},{"name":"Kuukasjarvi P."},{"name":"Karhunen P.J."},{"name":"Kahonen M."},{"name":"Laurikka J.O."},{"name":"Lehtimaki T."},{"name":"Asselbergs F.W."},{"name":"Moore J.H."}]},"pmid":"31702773","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/BIOINFORMATICS/BTZ796"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[],"editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"owner":"Pub2Tools","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":[],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:TPOT","biotoolsID":"TPOT","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-01-16T16:51:11Z","name":"TPOT","topic":[{"term":"Machine learning","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3474"},{"term":"Workflows","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0769"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Genotype and phenotype","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0625"},{"term":"Membrane and lipoproteins","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0820"}],"additionDate":"2020-01-14T09:24:57Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Robust Moiety Model Selection Using Mass Spectrometry Measured Isotopologues.","language":["Python"],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Metabolic network modelling","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3660"},{"term":"Deisotoping","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3629"},{"term":"Natural product identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3803"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":null,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1101/839241"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[],"editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"owner":"Pub2Tools","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":[],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:SIRM","biotoolsID":"SIRM","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-01-16T13:48:18Z","name":"SIRM","topic":[{"term":"NMR","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0593"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Endocrinology and metabolism","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3407"},{"term":"Molecular interactions, pathways and networks","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0602"}],"additionDate":"2020-01-14T09:48:42Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://pypi.org/project/moiety-modeling/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Other"],"url":"https://git.embl.de/grp-bork/sf-matching"}],"description":"SF-Matching(SubFragment-Matching) is a machine-learning based approach to predict compounds from tandem mass spectra.","language":[],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Rarefaction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3797"},{"term":"Deposition","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3431"},{"term":"Spectrum calculation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3860"},{"term":"Natural product identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3803"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2020-02-15T00:00:00Z","citationCount":13,"journal":"Bioinformatics","abstract":"Â© 2020 Oxford University Press.

However, fast and accurate identification of the metabolites' structures from MS/MS spectra is still a great challenge. Results: We present a new analysis method, called SubFragment-Matching (SF-Matching) that is based on the hypothesis that molecules with similar structural features will exhibit similar fragmentation patterns. We combine information on fragmentation patterns of molecules with shared substructures and then use random forest models to predict whether a given structure can yield a certain fragmentation pattern. These models can then be used to score candidate molecules for a given mass spectrum. For rapid identification, we pre-compute such scores for common biological molecular structure databases. Using benchmarking datasets, we find that our method has similar performance to CSI: FingerID and those very high accuracies can be achieved by combining our method with CSI: FingerID. Rarefaction analysis of the training dataset shows that the performance of our method will increase as more experimental data become available.","title":"Identification of metabolites from tandem mass spectra with a machine learning approach utilizing structural features","authors":[{"name":"Li Y."},{"name":"Kuhn M."},{"name":"Gavin A.-C."},{"name":"Bork P."}]},"pmid":"31605112","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/BIOINFORMATICS/BTZ736"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[],"editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"owner":"Pub2Tools","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":[],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:SF-Matching","biotoolsID":"SF-Matching","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-01-16T13:31:06Z","name":"SF-Matching","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Machine learning","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3474"},{"term":"Molecular biology","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3047"}],"additionDate":"2020-01-09T17:55:58Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://www.bork.embl.de/Docu/sf_matching"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Real-time is a health monitoring through urine metabolomics.","language":["Python"],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Quantification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3799"},{"term":"Principal component visualisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2939"},{"term":"Natural product identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3803"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":null,"pmid":"31728416","pmcid":"PMC6848197","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1038/S41746-019-0185-Y"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Joshua J.

All rights reserved.Motivation: When metabolites are analyzed by electrospray ionization (ESI)-mass spectrometry, they are usually detected as multiple ion species due to the presence of isotopes, adducts and in-source fragments. The signals generated by these degenerate features (along with contaminants and other chemical noise) obscure meaningful patterns in MS data, complicating both compound identification and downstream statistical analysis. To address this problem, we developed Binner, a new tool for the discovery and elimination of many degenerate feature signals typically present in untargeted ESI-LC-MS metabolomics data. Results: Binner generates feature annotations and provides tools to help users visualize informative feature relationships that can further elucidate the underlying structure of the data. To demonstrate the utility of Binner and to evaluate its performance, we analyzed data from reversed phase LC-MS and hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) platforms and demonstrated the accuracy of selected annotations using MS/MS. When we compared Binner annotations of 75 compounds previously identified in human plasma samples with annotations generated by three similar tools, we found that Binner achieves superior performance in the number and accuracy of annotations while simultaneously minimizing the number of incorrectly annotated principal ions. Data reduction and pattern exploration with Binner have allowed us to catalog a number of previously unrecognized complex adducts and neutral losses generated during the ionization of molecules in LC-MS. In summary, Binner allows users to explore patterns in their data and to efficiently and accurately eliminate a significant number of the degenerate features typically found in various LC-MS modalities.","title":"Deep annotation of untargeted LC-MS metabolomics data with Binner","authors":[{"name":"Kachman M."},{"name":"Habra H."},{"name":"Duren W."},{"name":"Wigginton J."},{"name":"Sajjakulnukit P."},{"name":"Michailidis G."},{"name":"Burant C."},{"name":"Karnovsky A."}]},"pmid":"31642507","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/BIOINFORMATICS/BTZ798"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[],"editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"owner":"Pub2Tools","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:Binner","biotoolsID":"Binner","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-01-14T16:48:36Z","name":"Binner","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"},{"term":"Bioinformatics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0091"}],"additionDate":"2020-01-09T17:38:56Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://binner.med.umich.edu"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/SBRG/bigg_models/blob/master/bigg_models/tests"},{"note":null,"type":["Other"],"url":"http://bigg.ucsd.edu/updates"},{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/SBRG/bigg_models"}],"description":"BiGG Models is a website for browsing gold-standard genome-scale models, multi-strain genome-scale models and expansion across the phylogenetic tree.\nBiGG Models is a knowledgebase of genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions.","language":["JavaScript","Python"],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Metabolic network modelling","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3660"},{"term":"Phylogenetic tree editing","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0326"},{"term":"Phylogenetic tree generation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0323"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":36,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","abstract":"Â© 2019 The Author(s).

This step requires selection of dataset-specific parameters, as erroneous parameters can result in noise inflation. While several algorithms exist to automate parameter selection, each depends on gradient descent optimization functions. In contrast, our new parameter optimization algorithm, AutoTuner, obtains parameter estimates from raw data in a single step as opposed to many iterations. Here, we tested the accuracy and the run-time of AutoTuner in comparison to isotopologue parameter optimization (IPO), the most commonly used parameter selection tool, and compared the resulting parameters' influence on the properties of feature tables after processing. We performed a Monte Carlo experiment to test the robustness of AutoTuner parameter selection and found that AutoTuner generated similar parameter estimates from random subsets of samples. We conclude that AutoTuner is a desirable alternative to existing tools, because it is scalable, highly robust, and very fast (â¼100-1000Ã speed improvement from other algorithms going from days to minutes).

The aims of this study were to build a model predicting low levels of 6-thioguanine and 6-methylmercaptopurine in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and to build a model to predict nonadherence in patients treated with azathioprine (AZA). Methods: The study consisted of 332 observations in 88 pediatric IBD patients. Low AZA dosing was defined as 6-thioguanine levels <125 pmol/8 Ã 108 erythrocytes and 6-methylmercaptopurine levels <5700 pmol/8 Ã 108 erythrocytes. Nonadherence was defined as undetectable levels of 6-thioguanine and 6-methylmercaptopurine <240 pmol/8 Ã 108 erythrocytes. Data were divided into training and testing part. To construct the model predicting low 6-thioguanine levels, nonadherence, and the level of 6-thioguanine, the modification of random forest method with cross-validation and resampling was used. Results: The final models predicting low 6-thioguanine levels and nonadherence had area under the curve, 0.87 and 0.94; sensitivity, 0.81 and 0.82; specificity, 0.80 and 86; and distance, 0.31 and 0.21, respectively, when applied on the testing part of the dataset. When the final model for prediction of 6-thioguanine values was applied on testing dataset, a root-mean-square error of 110 was obtained. Conclusions: Using easily obtained laboratory parameters, we constructed a model with sufficient accuracy to predict patients with low 6-thioguanine levels and a model for prediction of AZA treatment nonadherence (web applications: https://hradskyo.shinyapps.io/6TG-prediction/ and https://hradskyo.shinyapps.io/Non-adherence/).","title":"Prediction of Thiopurine Metabolite Levels Based on Haematological and Biochemical Parameters","authors":[{"name":"Hradsky O."},{"name":"Potuznikova K."},{"name":"Siroka J."},{"name":"Lerchova T."},{"name":"Urbanek L."},{"name":"Mihal V."},{"name":"Spenerova M."},{"name":"Velganova-Veghova M."},{"name":"Karaskova E."},{"name":"Bronsky J."}]},"pmid":"31568041","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1097/MPG.0000000000002436"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[],"editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"owner":"Pub2Tools","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:nonadherence","biotoolsID":"nonadherence","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-01-14T08:18:25Z","name":"nonadherence","topic":[{"term":"Haematology","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3408"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"}],"additionDate":"2020-01-09T18:21:16Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://hradskyo.shinyapps.io/Non_adherence/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"PySpacell is a Python Package for Spatial Analysis of Cell Images.\n\nTechnologies such as microscopy, sequential hybridization, and mass spectrometry enable quantitative single-cell phenotypic and molecular measurements in situ.

Therefore, specific bioinformatic tools are necessary to infer biochemical reactions and metabolic structures that can be checked experimentally. Using an integrative approach combining genomic and metabolomic data in the red algal model Chondrus crispus, we show that, even metabolic pathways considered as conserved, like sterols or mycosporine-like amino acid synthesis pathways, undergo substantial turnover. This phenomenon, here formally defined as \u201cmetabolic pathway drift,\u201d is consistent with findings from other areas of evolutionary biology, indicating that a given phenotype can be conserved even if the underlying molecular mechanisms are changing. We present a proof of concept with a methodological approach to formalize the logical reasoning necessary to infer reactions and molecular structures, abstracting molecular transformations based on previous biochemical knowledge.

Our development of the Pathway Tools software was motivated by the need to construct biological knowledge resources that combine these many types of data, and that enable users to find and comprehend data of interest as quickly as possible through query and visualization tools. Further, we sought to support the development of metabolic flux models from pathway databases, and to use pathway information to leverage the interpretation of high-throughput data sets. Results: In the past 4 years we have enhanced the already extensive Pathway Tools software in several respects. It can now support metabolic-model execution through the Web, it provides a more accurate gap filler for metabolic models; it supports development of models for organism communities distributed across a spatial grid; and model results may be visualized graphically. Pathway Tools supports several new omics-data analysis tools including the Omics Dashboard, multi-pathway diagrams called pathway collages, a pathway-covering algorithm for metabolomics data analysis and an algorithm for generating mechanistic explanations of multi-omics data. We have also improved the core pathway/genome databases management capabilities of the software, providing new multi-organism search tools for organism communities, improved graphics rendering, faster performance and re-designed gene and metabolite pages.

The large-scale characterization of N-linked glycoproteins accomplished by mass spectrometry-based glycoproteomics has provided valuable insights into the interdependence of glycoprotein structure and protein function. However, these studies focused mainly on the analysis of specific sample type, and lack the integration of glycoproteomic data from different tissues, body fluids or cell types. Methods: In this study, we collected the human glycosite-containing peptides identified through their de-glycosylated forms by mass spectrometry from over 100 publications and unpublished datasets generated from our laboratory. A database resource termed N-GlycositeAtlas was created and further used for the distribution analyses of glycoproteins among different human cells, tissues and body fluids. Finally, a web interface of N-GlycositeAtlas was created to maximize the utility and value of the database. Results: The N-GlycositeAtlas database contains more than 30,000 glycosite-containing peptides (representing > 14,000 N-glycosylation sites) from more than 7200 N-glycoproteins from different biological sources including human-derived tissues, body fluids and cell lines from over 100 studies.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Lack of reliable peak detection impedes automated analysis of large-scale gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics datasets. Performance and outcome of individual peak-picking algorithms can differ widely depending on both algorithmic approach and parameters, as well as data acquisition method. Therefore, comparing and contrasting between algorithms is difficult. Here we present a workflow for improved peak picking (WiPP), a parameter optimising, multi-algorithm peak detection for GC-MS metabolomics. WiPP evaluates the quality of detected peaks using a machine learning-based classification scheme based on seven peak classes. The quality information returned by the classifier for each individual peak is merged with results from different peak detection algorithms to create one final high-quality peak set for immediate down-stream analysis. Medium- and low-quality peaks are kept for further inspection. By applyingWiPP to standard compound mixes and a complex biological dataset, we demonstrate that peak detection is improved through the novel way to assign peak quality, an automated parameter optimisation, and results in integration across different embedded peak picking algorithms. Furthermore, our approach can provide an impartial performance comparison of different peak picking algorithms.

This resulting data can be interpreted in terms related to metabolic flux. However, detection of a stable isotope in metabolites by mass spectrometry produces a profile of isotopologue peaks that requires deconvolution to ascertain the localization of isotope incorporation. Results: To aid the interpretation of the mass spectroscopy isotopologue profile, we have developed a moiety modeling framework for deconvoluting metabolite isotopologue profiles involving single and multiple isotope tracers. This moiety modeling framework provides facilities for moiety model representation, moiety model optimization, and moiety model selection. The moiety_modeling package was developed from the idea of metabolite decomposition into moiety units based on metabolic transformations, i.e. a moiety model. The SAGA-optimize package, solving a boundary-value inverse problem through a combined simulated annealing and genetic algorithm, was developed for model optimization. Additional optimization methods from the Python scipy library are utilized as well. Several forms of the Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion are provided for selecting between moiety models. Moiety models and associated isotopologue data are defined in a JSONized format. By testing the moiety modeling framework on the timecourses of 13C isotopologue data for uridine diphosphate N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) in human prostate cancer LnCaP-LN3 cells, we were able to confirm its robust performance in isotopologue deconvolution and moiety model selection. Conclusions: SAGA-optimize is a useful Python package for solving boundary-value inverse problems, and the moiety_modeling package is an easy-to-use tool for mass spectroscopy isotopologue profile deconvolution involving single and multiple isotope tracers.

Although untargeted metabolomics is often applied to understand the mode of action of these chemicals, simple pairwise comparisons of treated and untreated samples are insufficient to resolve the effects of disrupting two or more independent protein targets. Here, we introduce a workflow for dose-response metabolomics to evaluate chemicals that potentially affect multiple proteins with different potencies. Our approach relies on treating samples with various concentrations of compound prior to analysis with mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Data are then processed with software we developed called TOXcms, which statistically evaluates dose-response trends for each metabolomic signal according to user-defined tolerances and subsequently groups those that follow the same pattern. Although TOXcms was built upon the XCMS framework, it is compatible with any metabolomic data-processing software. Additionally, to enable correlation of dose responses beyond those that can be measured by metabolomics, TOXcms also accepts data from respirometry, cell death assays, other omic platforms, etc. In this work, we primarily focus on applying dose-response metabolomics to find off-target effects of drugs. Using metformin and etomoxir as examples, we demonstrate that each group of dose-response patterns identified by TOXcms signifies a metabolic response to a different protein target with a unique drug binding affinity.

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND: Blood chemicals are routinely measured in clinical or preclinical research studies to diagnose diseases, assess risks in epidemiological research, or use metabolomic phenotyping in response to treatments. A vast volume of blood-related literature is available via the PubMed database for data mining. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to generate a comprehensive blood exposome database of endogenous and exogenous chemicals associated with the mammalian circulating system through text mining and database fusion. METHODS: Using NCBI resources, we retrieved PubMed abstracts, PubChem chemical synonyms, and PMC supplementary tables. We then employed text mining and PubChem crowdsourcing to associate phrases relating to blood with PubChem chemicals. False positives were removed by a phrase pattern and a compound exclusion list. RESULTS: A query to identify blood-related publications in the PubMed database yielded 1.1 million papers. Matching a total of 15 million synonyms from 6.5 million relevant PubChem chemicals against all blood-related publications yielded 37,514 chemicals and 851,999 publications records. Mapping PubChem compound identifiers to the PubMed database yielded 49,940 unique chemicals linked to 676,643 papers. Analysis of open-access metabolomics papers related to blood phrases in the PMC database yielded 4,039 unique compounds and 204 papers. Consolidating these three approaches summed up to a total of 41,474 achiral structures that were linked to 65,957 PubChem CIDs and to over 878,966 PubMed articles. We mapped these compounds to 50 databases such as those covering metabolites and pathways, governmental and toxicological databases, pharmacology resources, and bioassay repositories. In comparison, HMDB, the Human Metabolome Database, links 1,075 compounds to blood-related primary publications. CONCLUSION: This new Blood Exposome Database can be used for prioritizing chemicals for systematic reviews, developing target assays in exposome research, identifying compounds in untargeted mass spectrometry, and biological interpretation in metabolomics data.

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Fueled by the explosion of (meta)genomic data, genome mining of specialized metabolites has become a major technology for drug discovery and studying microbiome ecology. In these efforts, computational tools like antiSMASH have played a central role through the analysis of Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs). Thousands of candidate BGCs from microbial genomes have been identified and stored in public databases. Interpreting the function and novelty of these predicted BGCs requires comparison with a well-documented set of BGCs of known function. The MIBiG (Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene Cluster) Data Standard and Repository was established in 2015 to enable curation and storage of known BGCs. Here, we present MIBiG 2.0, which encompasses major updates to the schema, the data, and the online repository itself. Over the past five years, 851 new BGCs have been added. Additionally, we performed extensive manual data curation of all entries to improve the annotation quality of our repository.

As the researchers struggle with these skills, there is a dire need to develop software packages that can automatically install software pipelines truly speeding up the learning curve to build software workstations. Therefore, this paper aims to provide MetumpX, a software package that eases in the installation of 103 software by automatically resolving their individual dependencies and also allowing the users to choose which software works best for them.

Open source processing and analysis tools are of major interest in light of innovative, open and reproducible science. The scientific community has developed a wide range of open source software, providing freely available advanced processing and analysis approaches. The programming and statistics environment R has emerged as one of the most popular environments to process and analyse Metabolomics datasets. A major benefit of such an environment is the possibility of connecting different tools into more complex workflows. Combining reusable data processing R scripts with the experimental data thus allows for open, reproducible research. This review provides an extensive overview of existing packages in R for different steps in a typical computational metabolomics workflow, including data processing, biostatistics, metabolite annotation and identification, and biochemical network and pathway analysis. Multifunctional workflows, possible user interfaces and integration into workflow management systems are also reviewed.

Software solutions and extensive compound libraries facilitate the efficient analysis of MS1 data, regardless of the analytical platform. However, the development of comparable tools for DIA data analysis has significantly lagged. This research introduces an update to the former MetaboList R package and a workflow for full-scan MS1 and MS/MS DIA processing of metabolomic data from multiplexed liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) experiments. When compared to the former version, new functions have been added to address isolated MS1 and MS/MS workflows, processing of MS/MS data from stepped collision energies, performance scoring of metabolite annotations, and batch job analysis were incorporated into the update. The flexibility and efficiency of this strategy were assessed through the study of the metabolite profiles of human urine, leukemia cell culture, and medium samples analyzed by either liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight (q-TOF) or quadrupole orbital (q-Orbitrap) instruments. This open-source alternative was designed to promote global metabolomic strategies based on recursive retrospective research of multiplexed DIA analysis.","title":"R-metabolist 2: A flexible tool for metabolite annotation from high-resolution data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry analysis","authors":[{"name":"Peris-Diaz M.D."},{"name":"Sweeney S.R."},{"name":"Rodak O."},{"name":"Sentandreu E."},{"name":"Tiziani S."}]},"pmid":"31533242","pmcid":"PMC6780920","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.3390/METABO9090187"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4157-580X","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Enrique Sentandreu","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"infusoriosentandreu@gmail.com","url":null,"typeRole":[]},{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7230-0307","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Stefano Tiziani","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"tiziani@austin.utexas.edu","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"owner":"Pub2Tools","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Library"],"license":"GPL-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:MetaboList","biotoolsID":"MetaboList","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-12-28T09:04:34Z","name":"MetaboList","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"}],"additionDate":"2019-11-14T19:53:53Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MetaboList"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"A Python package for mass spectrometry data processing and visualization | Python package for efficient MS/MS spectrum processing and visualization | spectrum_utils is a Python package for efficient MS/MS spectrum processing and visualization","language":["Python"],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Spectrum calculation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3860"},{"term":"Mass spectrum visualisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3694"},{"term":"Peptide database search","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3646"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":null,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1101/725036"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[],"editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"owner":"Pub2Tools","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":[],"license":"Apache-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:spectrum_utils","biotoolsID":"spectrum_utils","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-12-24T08:57:33Z","name":"spectrum_utils","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"}],"additionDate":"2019-11-14T18:01:41Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/bittremieux/spectrum_utils"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"General Analysis Utilities for Dynamic Omics Datasets.\n\nMathIOmica is a package for bioinformatics, written in the Wolfram language, that provides multiple utilities to facilitate the analysis of longitudinal data generated from omics experiments, including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data, as well as any generalized time series.

Recently, the Molecular Atlas of Lung Development Program (LungMAP) was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to develop an integrated open access database (known as BREATH) to characterize the molecular and cellular anatomy of the developing lung. To support this effort, we designed detailed anatomic and cellular ontologies describing alveolar formation and maturation in both mouse and human lung. Description: While the general anatomic organization of the lung is similar for these two species, there are significant variations in the lung's architectural organization, distribution of connective tissue, and cellular composition along the respiratory tract. Anatomic ontologies for both species were constructed as partonomic hierarchies and organized along the lung's proximal-distal axis into respiratory, vascular, neural, and immunologic components. Terms for developmental and adult lung structures, tissues, and cells were included, providing comprehensive ontologies for application at varying levels of resolution. Using established scientific resources, multiple rounds of comparison were performed to identify common, analogous, and unique terms that describe the lungs of these two species. Existing biological and biomedical ontologies were examined and cross-referenced to facilitate integration at a later time, while additional terms were drawn from the scientific literature as needed. This comparative approach eliminated redundancy and inconsistent terminology, enabling us to differentiate true anatomic variations between mouse and human lungs. As a result, approximately 300 terms for fetal and postnatal lung structures, tissues, and cells were identified for each species. Conclusion: These ontologies standardize and expand current terminology for fetal and adult lungs, providing a qualitative framework for data annotation, retrieval, and integration across a wide variety of datasets in the BREATH database. To our knowledge, these are the first ontologies designed to include terminology specific for developmental structures in the lung, as well as to compare common anatomic features and variations between mouse and human lungs. These ontologies provide a unique resource for the LungMAP, as well as for the broader scientific community.","title":"Comprehensive anatomic ontologies for lung development: A comparison of alveolar formation and maturation within mouse and human lung","authors":[{"name":"Pan H."},{"name":"Deutsch G.H."},{"name":"Wert S.E."}]},"pmid":"31651362","pmcid":"PMC6814058","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1186/S13326-019-0209-1"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6643-5769","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Susan E.

Complex study designs have the potential to address this concern, though they remain undervalued by investigators due to the lack of proper analysis methods. The primary challenge in the analysis of complex microarray study data is handling the correlation structure within data while also dealing with the combination of large number of genetic measurements and small number of subjects that are ubiquitous even in standard microarray studies. Motivated by the lack of available methods for analysis of repeatedly measured phenotypic or transcriptomic data, herein we develop a longitudinal linear combination test (LLCT). Results: LLCT is a two-step method to analyze multiple longitudinal phenotypes when there is high dimensionality in response and/or explanatory variables. Alternating between calculating within-subjects and between-subjects variations in two steps, LLCT examines if the maximum possible correlation between a linear combination of the time trends and a linear combination of the predictors given by the gene expressions is statistically significant. A generalization of this method can handle family-based study designs when the subjects are not independent. This method is also applicable to time-course microarray, with the ability to identify gene sets that exhibit significantly different expression patterns over time. Based on the results from a simulation study, LLCT outperformed its alternative: pathway analysis via regression. LLCT was shown to be very powerful in the analysis of large gene sets even when the sample size is small. Conclusions: This self-contained pathway analysis method is applicable to a wide range of longitudinal genomics, proteomics, metabolomics (OMICS) data, allows adjusting for potentially time-dependent covariates and works well with unbalanced and incomplete data. An important potential application of this method could be time-course linkage of OMICS, an attractive possibility for future genetic researchers.

Determining the lipidome of cellular model systems in common use is of particular importance, especially when research questions involve lipids directly. In Parkinson's disease research, there is a growing awareness for the role of the biological membrane, where individual lipids may contribute to provoking Î±-synuclein oligomerisation and fibrillation. We present an analysis of the whole cell and plasma membrane lipid isolates of a neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, a commonly used model system for research on this and other neurodegenerative diseases. We have used two complementary lipidomics methods. The relative quantities of PC, PE, SMs, CL, PI, PG, and PS were determined by 31P NMR. Fatty acid chain composition and their relative abundances within each phospholipid group were evaluated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. For this part of the analysis, we have developed and made available a set of Matlab scripts, LipMat. Our approach allowed us to observe several deviations of lipid abundances when compared to published reports regarding phospholipid analysis of cell cultures or brain matter. The most striking was the high abundance of PC (54.7 Â± 1.9%) and low abundance of PE (17.8 Â± 4.8%) and SMs (2.7 Â± 1.2%).

All rights reserved.Microbial natural products represent a rich resource of evolved chemistry that forms the basis for the majority of pharmacotherapeutics. Ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are a particularly interesting class of natural products noted for their unique mode of biosynthesis and biological activities. Analyses of sequenced microbial genomes have revealed an enormous number of biosynthetic loci encoding RiPPs but whose products remain cryptic. In parallel, analyses of bacterial metabolomes typically assign chemical structures to only a minority of detected metabolites. Aligning these 2 disparate sources of data could provide a comprehensive strategy for natural product discovery. Here we present DeepRiPP, an integrated genomic and metabolomic platform that employs machine learning to automate the selective discovery and isolation of novel RiPPs. DeepRiPP includes 3 modules. The first, NLPPrecursor, identifies RiPPs independent of genomic context and neighboring biosynthetic genes. The second module, BARLEY, prioritizes loci that encode novel compounds, while the third, CLAMS, automates the isolation of their corresponding products from complex bacterial extracts. DeepRiPP pinpoints target metabolites using large-scale comparative metabolomics analysis across a database of 10,498 extracts generated from 463 strains. We apply the DeepRiPP platform to expand the landscape of novel RiPPs encoded within sequenced genomes and to discover 3 novel RiPPs, whose structures are exactly as predicted by our platform. By building on advances in machine learning technologies, DeepRiPP integrates genomic and metabolomic data to guide the isolation of novel RiPPs in an automated manner.","title":"DeepRiPP integrates multiomics data to automate discovery of novel ribosomally synthesized natural products","authors":[{"name":"Merwin N.J."},{"name":"Mousa W.K."},{"name":"Dejong C.A."},{"name":"Skinnider M.A."},{"name":"Cannon M.J."},{"name":"Li H."},{"name":"Dial K."},{"name":"Gunabalasingam M."},{"name":"Johnston C."},{"name":"Magarvey N.A."}]},"pmid":"31871149","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1073/PNAS.1901493116"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[],"editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"owner":"Pub2Tools","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:DeepRiPP","biotoolsID":"DeepRiPP","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-12-20T11:29:27Z","name":"DeepRiPP","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"},{"term":"Machine learning","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3474"},{"term":"Cell biology","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2229"},{"term":"Chemistry","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3314"}],"additionDate":"2020-01-14T19:43:58Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://deepripp.magarveylab.ca"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Mirror"],"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/SDAMS/"},{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://git.bioconductor.org/packages/SDAMS"}],"description":"This Package utilizes a Semi-parametric Differential Abundance analysis (SDA) method for metabolomics and proteomics data from mass spectrometry.

However, software tools for deconvolving multiplexed MS/MS spectra from SWATH-MS with high efficiency and high quality are still lacking in untargeted metabolomics. Here, we developed a new software tool, namely, DecoMetDIA, to deconvolve multiplexed MS/MS spectra for metabolite identification and support the SWATH-based untargeted metabolomics. In DecoMetDIA, multiple model peaks are selected to model the coeluted and unresolved chromatographic peaks of fragment ions in multiplexed spectra and decompose them into a linear combination of the model peaks. DecoMetDIA enabled us to reconstruct the MS2 spectra of metabolites from a variety of different biological samples with high coverages. We also demonstrated that the deconvolved MS2 spectra from DecoMetDIA were of high accuracy through comparison to the experimental MS2 spectra from data-dependent acquisition (DDA). Finally, about 90% of deconvolved MS2 spectra in various biological samples were successfully annotated using software tools such as MetDNA and Sirius.

Modules, i.e., groups of nodes with similar topological properties in these networks characterize important biological functions of the underlying biomolecular system. Edges in such molecular networks represent regulatory and physical interactions, and comparing them between conditions provides valuable information on differential molecular mechanisms. However, biological data is inherently noisy and network reduction techniques can propagate errors particularly to the level of edges. We aim to improve the analysis of networks of biological molecules by deriving modules together with edge relevance estimations that are based on global network characteristics. Methods: The key challenge we address here is investigating the capability of stochastic block models (SBMs) for representing and analyzing different types of biomolecular networks. Fitting them to SBMs both delivers modules of the networks and enables the derivation of edge confidence scores, and it has not yet been investigated for analyzing biomolecular networks. We apply SBM-based analysis independently to three correlation-based networks of breast cancer data originating from high-throughput measurements of different molecular layers: either transcriptomics, proteomics, or metabolomics. The networks were reduced by thresholding for correlation significance or by requirements on scale-freeness. Results and discussion: We find that the networks are best represented by the hierarchical version of the SBM, and many of the predicted blocks have a biologically and phenotypically relevant functional annotation. The edge confidence scores are overall in concordance with the biological evidence given by the measurements. We conclude that biomolecular networks can be appropriately represented and analyzed by fitting SBMs. As the SBM-derived edge confidence scores are based on global network connectivity characteristics and potential hierarchies within the biomolecular networks are considered, they could be used as additional, integrated features in network-based data comparisons.","title":"Analysis of correlation-based biomolecular networks from different omics data by fitting stochastic block models","authors":[{"name":"Rajapakse J.C."},{"name":"Azuaje F."},{"name":"Baum K."}]},"pmid":"31559017","pmcid":"PMC6743255","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.12688/F1000RESEARCH.18705.2"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Jagath C.

Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.The type IV bacterial secretion system (SS) is reported to be one of the most ubiquitous SSs in nature and can induce serious conditions by secreting type IV SS effectors (T4SEs) into the host cells. Recent studies mainly focus on annotating new T4SE from the huge amount of sequencing data, and various computational tools are therefore developed to accelerate T4SE annotation. However, these tools are reported as heavily dependent on the selected methods and their annotation performance need to be further enhanced. Herein, a convolution neural network (CNN) technique was used to annotate T4SEs by integrating multiple protein encoding strategies. First, the annotation accuracies of nine encoding strategies integrated with CNN were assessed and compared with that of the popular T4SE annotation tools based on independent benchmark. Second, false discovery rates of various models were systematically evaluated by (1) scanning the genome of Legionella pneumophila subsp. ATCC 33152 and (2) predicting the real-world non-T4SEs validated using published experiments. Based on the above analyses, the encoding strategies, (a) position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), (b) protein secondary structure & solvent accessibility (PSSSA) and (c) one-hot encoding scheme (Onehot), were identified as well-performing when integrated with CNN. Finally, a novel strategy that collectively considers the three well-performing models (CNN-PSSM, CNN-PSSSA and CNN-Onehot) was proposed, and a new tool (CNN-T4SE, https://idrblab.org/cnnt4se/) was constructed to facilitate T4SE annotation. All in all, this study conducted a comprehensive analysis on the performance of a collection of encoding strategies when integrated with CNN, which could facilitate the suppression of T4SS in infection and limit the spread of antimicrobial resistance.","title":"Convolutional neural network-based annotation of bacterial type IV secretion system effectors with enhanced accuracy and reduced false discovery","authors":[{"name":"Hong J."},{"name":"Luo Y."},{"name":"Mou M."},{"name":"Fu J."},{"name":"Zhang Y."},{"name":"Xue W."},{"name":"Xie T."},{"name":"Tao L."},{"name":"Lou Y."},{"name":"Zhu F."}]},"pmid":"31860715","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/BIB/BBZ120"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[],"editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"owner":"Pub2Tools","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"https://idrblab.org/cnnt4se/download/User_Manual_of_CNN-T4SE.pdf"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:CNN-T4SE","biotoolsID":"CNN-T4SE","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-12-16T16:00:27Z","name":"CNN-T4SE","topic":[{"term":"Machine learning","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3474"},{"term":"Protein secondary structure","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3542"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"},{"term":"Pharmacology","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0202"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"}],"additionDate":"2020-01-14T19:54:17Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://idrblab.org/cnnt4se/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[{"note":null,"type":["Galaxy service"],"url":"https://workflow4metabolomics.usegalaxy.fr"},{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/workflow4metabolomics"},{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://www.mybiosoftware.com/workflow4metabolomics-v3-metabolomics-data-processing-analysis-and-annotation.html"},{"note":null,"type":["Social media"],"url":"https://twitter.com/workflow4metabo"}],"description":"First fully open-source and collaborative online platform for computational metabolomics.

By using three studies in human physiology, alga evolution, and animal toxicology, we demonstrate how the 40 available tools can be easily combined to address biological issues. Second, the full analysis (including the workflow, the parameter values, the input data and output results) can be referenced with a permanent digital object identifier (DOI). Publication of data analyses is of major importance for robust and reproducible science. Furthermore, the publicly shared workflows are of high-value for e-learning and training.

Our manually curated model is more accurate than S. mutans models generated from automated reconstruction pipelines and more complete than other manually curated models. We used iSMU to generate hypotheses about the S. mutans metabolic network. Subsequent genetic experiments confirmed that (i) S. mutans catabolizes sorbitol via a sorbitol-6-phosphate 2-dehydrogenase (SMU-308) and (ii) the Leloir pathway is required for growth on complex carbohydrates such as raffinose. We believe the iSMU model is an important resource for understanding the metabolism of S. mutans and guiding future experiments. Importance: Tooth decay is the most prevalent chronic disease in the United States. Decay is caused by the bacterium Streptococcus mutans, an oral pathogen that ferments sugars into tooth-destroying lactic acid. We constructed a complete metabolic model of S. mutans to systematically investigate how the bacterium grows. The model provides a valuable resource for understanding and targeting S. mutans' ability to outcompete other species in the oral microbiome.","title":"Metabolic modeling of Streptococcus mutans reveals complex nutrient requirements of an oral pathogen","authors":[{"name":"Jijakli K."},{"name":"Jensen P.A."}]},"pmid":"31662430","pmcid":"PMC6819733","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1128/MSYSTEMS.00529-19"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1257-9836","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Paul A.

The association of these experimental features to the underlying metabolites still represents one of the major bottlenecks in metabolomics data processing. While certain identification (e.g., by comparison to authentic standards) is always desirable, it is usually achievable only for a limited number of compounds, and scientists often deal with a significant amount of putatively annotated metabolites. The confidence in a specific annotation is usually assessed by considering different sources of information (e.g., isotope patterns, adduct formation, chromatographic retention times, and fragmentation patterns). IPA (integrated probabilistic annotation) offers a rigorous and reproducible method to automatically annotate metabolite profiles and evaluate the resulting confidence of the putative annotations. It is able to provide a rigorous measure of our confidence in any putative annotation and is also able to update and refine our beliefs (i.e., background prior knowledge) by incorporating different sources of information in the annotation process, such as isotope patterns, adduct formation and biochemical relations.

Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) characterizes the spatial distribution of ions in complex biological samples such as tissues. Since many tissues have complex morphology, treatments and conditions often affect the spatial distribution of the ions in morphology-specific ways. Evaluating the selectivity and the specificity of ion localization and regulation across morphology types is biologically important. However, MSI lacks algorithms for segmenting images at both single-ion and spatial resolution. Results: This article contributes spatial-Dirichlet Gaussian mixture model (DGMM), an algorithm and a workflow for the analyses of MSI experiments, that detects components of single-ion images with homogeneous spatial composition. The approach extends DGMMs to account for the spatial structure of MSI. Evaluations on simulated and experimental datasets with diverse MSI workflows demonstrated that spatial-DGMM accurately segments ion images, and can distinguish ions with homogeneous and heterogeneous spatial distribution. We also demonstrated that the extracted spatial information is useful for downstream analyses, such as detecting morphology-specific ions, finding groups of ions with similar spatial patterns, and detecting changes in chemical composition of tissues between conditions.","title":"Unsupervised segmentation of mass spectrometric ion images characterizes morphology of tissues","authors":[{"name":"Guo D."},{"name":"Bemis K."},{"name":"Rawlins C."},{"name":"Agar J."},{"name":"Vitek O."}]},"pmid":"31510675","pmcid":"PMC6612871","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/BIOINFORMATICS/BTZ345"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Olga Vitek","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"o.vitek@neu.edu","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"owner":"Pub2Tools","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Library"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:IonSpattern","biotoolsID":"IonSpattern","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-12-14T12:58:47Z","name":"IonSpattern","topic":[{"term":"Imaging","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3382"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"}],"additionDate":"2019-11-14T20:03:15Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/Vitek-Lab/IonSpattern"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Integrated Supportive Webtools for Low- and High-Field NMR Analyses Toward Molecular Complexity | Description SpinLIMS Contact Others | Integrated supportive webtools for low- and high-field NMR analysis toward molecular complexities | SENsitivity improvement with Spectral Integration","language":[],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Peak detection","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3215"},{"term":"Spectral counting","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3637"},{"term":"Dimethyl","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3642"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2019-02-14T00:00:00Z","citationCount":8,"journal":"ACS Omega","abstract":"Â© Copyright 2019 American Chemical Society.

To support handling of the broad spectra obtained from solid-state NMR or low-field benchtop NMR, we have developed and evaluated two preprocessing tools: sensitivity improvement with spectral integration, which enhances the signal-to-noise ratio by spectral integration, and peaks separation, which separates overlapping peaks by several algorithms, such as non-negative sparse coding. In addition, the InterSpin Laboratory Information Management System (SpinLIMS) database stores numerous standard spectra ranging from small molecules to macromolecules in solid and solution states (dissolved in polar/nonpolar solvents), and can be searched under various conditions using the following molecular assignment tools. SpinMacro supports easy assignment of macromolecules in natural mixtures via solid-state 13 C peaks and dimethyl sulfoxide-dissolved 1 H- 13 C correlation peaks. InterAnalysis improves the accuracy of molecular assignment by integrated analysis of 1 H- 13 C correlation peaks and 1 H-J correlation peaks of small molecules dissolved in D 2 O or deuterated methanol, which supports easy narrowing down of metabolite candidates. Finally, by enabling database interoperability, SpinLIMS's client software will ultimately support scientific discovery by facilitating sharing and reusing of NMR data.","title":"InterSpin: Integrated Supportive Webtools for Low- and High-Field NMR Analyses Toward Molecular Complexity","authors":[{"name":"Yamada S."},{"name":"Ito K."},{"name":"Kurotani A."},{"name":"Yamada Y."},{"name":"Chikayama E."},{"name":"Kikuchi J."}]},"pmid":"31459550","pmcid":"PMC6648201","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/ACSOMEGA.8B02714"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Jun Kikuchi","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"jun.kikuchi@riken.jp","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"owner":"Pub2Tools","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:InterSpin","biotoolsID":"InterSpin","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-12-14T12:47:58Z","name":"InterSpin","topic":[{"term":"NMR","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0593"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"}],"additionDate":"2019-11-14T18:09:13Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://dmar.riken.jp/interspin/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Extending immunopharmacology content and introducing the IUPHAR/MMV Guide to MALARIA PHARMACOLOGY.\n\nIUPHAR Guide to IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY.\n\nThe IUPHAR/BPS Guide to IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Independent component analysis (ICA) is a matrix factorization approach where the signals captured by each individual matrix factors are optimized to become as mutually independent as possible. Initially suggested for solving source blind separation problems in various fields, ICA was shown to be successful in analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and other types of biomedical data. In the last twenty years, ICA became a part of the standard machine learning toolbox, together with other matrix factorization methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Here, we review a number of recent works where ICA was shown to be a useful tool for unraveling the complexity of cancer biology from the analysis of different types of omics data, mainly collected for tumoral samples. Such works highlight the use of ICA in dimensionality reduction, deconvolution, data pre-processing, meta-analysis, and others applied to different data types (transcriptome, methylome, proteome, single-cell data). We particularly focus on the technical aspects of ICA application in omics studies such as using different protocols, determining the optimal number of components, assessing and improving reproducibility of the ICA results, and comparison with other popular matrix factorization techniques. We discuss the emerging ICA applications to the integrative analysis of multi-level omics datasets and introduce a conceptual view on ICA as a tool for defining functional subsystems of a complex biological system and their interactions under various conditions. Our review is accompanied by a Jupyter notebook which illustrates the discussed concepts and provides a practical tool for applying ICA to the analysis of cancer omics datasets.","title":"Independent component analysis for unraveling the complexity of cancer omics datasets","authors":[{"name":"Sompairac N."},{"name":"Nazarov P.V."},{"name":"Czerwinska U."},{"name":"Cantini L."},{"name":"Biton A."},{"name":"Molkenov A."},{"name":"Zhumadilov Z."},{"name":"Barillot E."},{"name":"Radvanyi F."},{"name":"Gorban A."},{"name":"Kairov U."},{"name":"Zinovyev A."}]},"pmid":"31500324","pmcid":"PMC6771121","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.3390/IJMS20184414"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Andrei Zinovyev","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"andrei.zinovyev@curie.fr","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"owner":"Pub2Tools","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Library"],"license":"GPL-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ICA","biotoolsID":"ICA","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-12-11T08:41:02Z","name":"ICA","topic":[{"term":"Transcriptomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3308"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Oncology","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2640"}],"additionDate":"2019-11-14T20:06:11Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/sysbio-curie/ICA-in-Cancer-research-review-materials"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://sourceforge.net/projects/cardiacpbpk/"}],"description":"A tool for the prediction and visualization of time-concentration profiles of drugs in heart tissue.\n\nCardiac mechanistic physiologically based pharmacokinetic simulation application.\n\nUser Interface (ui) application which implements PBPK models.\n\nPrediction of drug effect is valuable in terms of both safety and efficacy.\n\nphysiologically based pharmacokinetic-quantitative system.\n\n1) Download the tar.gz archive from the https: sourceforge.net projects cardiacpbpk files or clone github repository (if you have git packages installed in konsole terminal type \u2018git clone https: github.com jszlek CardiacPBPK.git\u2019)","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Visualisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0337"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":0,"journal":"Computers in Biology and Medicine","abstract":"Â© 2019 Elsevier LtdBackground and objective: Prediction of drug concentration in heart tissue is important in terms of drug safety and efficacy. This work presents the Open-Source CardiacPBPK platform for the prediction of the time-concentration profile of drugs, which could potentially reduce the risk of drug development failure due to cardiotoxicity.

Therefore, pooled quality control (QC) samples are often employed in quality management processes, which are indispensable to the success of metabolomics and proteomics experiments, especially in high-throughput cases and long-term projects. However, data consistency and QC sample stability are still difficult to guarantee because of the experimental operation complexity and differences between experimenters. To make things worse, numerous proteomics projects do not take QC samples into consideration at the beginning of experimental design. Herein, a powerful and interactive web-based software, named pseudoQC, is presented to simulate QC sample data for actual metabolomics and proteomics datasets using four different machine learning-based regression methods. The simulated data are used for correction and normalization of the two published datasets, and the obtained results suggest that nonlinear regression methods perform better than linear ones.

Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: The results from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) on thousands of phenotypes provide an unprecedented opportunity to infer the causal effect of one phenotype (exposure) on another (outcome). Mendelian randomization (MR), an instrumental variable (IV) method, has been introduced for causal inference using GWAS data. Due to the polygenic architecture of complex traits/diseases and the ubiquity of pleiotropy, however, MR has many unique challenges compared to conventional IV methods. Results: We propose a Bayesian weighted Mendelian randomization (BWMR) for causal inference to address these challenges. In our BWMR model, the uncertainty of weak effects owing to polygenicity has been taken into account and the violation of IV assumption due to pleiotropy has been addressed through outlier detection by Bayesian weighting. To make the causal inference based on BWMR computationally stable and efficient, we developed a variational expectation-maximization (VEM) algorithm. Moreover, we have also derived an exact closed-form formula to correct the posterior covariance which is often underestimated in variational inference. Through comprehensive simulation studies, we evaluated the performance of BWMR, demonstrating the advantage of BWMR over its competitors. Then we applied BWMR to make causal inference between 130 metabolites and 93 complex human traits, uncovering novel causal relationship between exposure and outcome traits.","title":"Bayesian weighted Mendelian randomization for causal inference based on summary statistics","authors":[{"name":"Zhao J."},{"name":"Ming J."},{"name":"Hu X."},{"name":"Chen G."},{"name":"Liu J."},{"name":"Yang C."}]},"pmid":"31593215","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/BIOINFORMATICS/BTZ749"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[],"editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"owner":"Pub2Tools","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":[],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:BWMR","biotoolsID":"BWMR","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-12-09T16:11:10Z","name":"BWMR","topic":[{"term":"GWAS study","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3517"},{"term":"Genotype and phenotype","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0625"},{"term":"Statistics and probability","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2269"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"}],"additionDate":"2020-01-09T17:54:39Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/jiazhao97/BWMR"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Web-based user interface for NMR-based untargeted metabolic profiling analysis in biomedical sciences.\n\nR package that provide interactive graphical interface for metabolic profiling.\n\nIf you find it useful, please cite this work.\n\nto convert R variables into a JSON object and save it as a file.\n\nhastaLaVista is developed and tested using Chrome, although it is known to work with other browser.

This unique combination of statistical programming and web-browser visualisation brings enhanced data interoperability and interactivity into the open source realm. It is exemplified by characterizing the extent to which bariatric surgery perturbs the metabolisms of rats, showing the value of the approach in iterative analysis by the end-user to establish a deeper understanding of the system perturbation.

Based on the most comprehensive biosynthesis knowledgebase, a computational system, BCSExplorer, is proposed to discover the unexplored chemical space using nature's biosynthetic potential. BCSExplorer first integrates the most comprehensive biosynthetic reaction database with 280 000 biochemical reactions and 60 000 chemicals biosynthesized globally over the past 130 years. Second, in this study, a biosynthesis tree is computed for a starting chemical molecule based on a comprehensive biotransformation rule library covering almost all biosynthetic possibilities, in which redundant rules are removed using a new algorithm. Moreover, biosynthesis feasibility, drug-likeness and toxicity analysis of a new generation of compounds will be pursued in further studies to meet various needs.

Results: We address this challenge through development of AMON: Annotation of Metabolite Origins via Networks. AMON is an open-source bioinformatics application that can be used to annotate which compounds in the metabolome could have been produced by bacteria present or the host, to evaluate pathway enrichment of host verses microbial metabolites, and to visualize which compounds may have been produced by host versus microbial enzymes in KEGG pathway maps. Conclusions: AMON empowers researchers to predict origins of metabolites via genomic information and to visualize potential host:microbe interplay. Additionally, the evaluation of enrichment of pathway metabolites of host versus microbial origin gives insight into the metabolic functionality that a microbial community adds to a host:microbe system. Through integrated analysis of microbiome and metabolome data, mechanistic relationships between microbial communities and host phenotypes can be better understood.","title":"AMON: Annotation of metabolite origins via networks to integrate microbiome and metabolome data","authors":[{"name":"Shaffer M."},{"name":"Thurimella K."},{"name":"Quinn K."},{"name":"Doenges K."},{"name":"Zhang X."},{"name":"Bokatzian S."},{"name":"Reisdorph N."},{"name":"Lozupone C.A."}]},"pmid":"31779604","pmcid":"PMC6883642","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1186/S12859-019-3176-8"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"C.

Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: Metabolite identification is an important task in metabolomics to enhance the knowledge of biological systems. There have been a number of machine learning-based methods proposed for this task, which predict a chemical structure of a given spectrum through an intermediate (chemical structure) representation called molecular fingerprints. They usually have two steps: (i) predicting fingerprints from spectra; (ii) searching chemical compounds (in database) corresponding to the predicted fingerprints. Fingerprints are feature vectors, which are usually very large to cover all possible substructures and chemical properties, and therefore heavily redundant, in the sense of having many molecular (sub)structures irrelevant to the task, causing limited predictive performance and slow prediction. Results: We propose ADAPTIVE, which has two parts: learning two mappings (i) from structures to molecular vectors and (ii) from spectra to molecular vectors. The first part learns molecular vectors for metabolites from given data, to be consistent with both spectra and chemical structures of metabolites. In more detail, molecular vectors are generated by a model, being parameterized by a message passing neural network, and parameters are estimated by maximizing the correlation between molecular vectors and the corresponding spectra in terms of Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion. Molecular vectors generated by this model are compact and importantly adaptive (specific) to both given data and task of metabolite identification. The second part uses input output kernel regression (IOKR), the current cutting-edge method of metabolite identification. We empirically confirmed the effectiveness of ADAPTIVE by using a benchmark data, where ADAPTIVE outperformed the original IOKR in both predictive performance and computational efficiency.","title":"ADAPTIVE: LeArning DAta-dePendenT, concIse molecular VEctors for fast, accurate metabolite identification from tandem mass spectra","authors":[{"name":"Nguyen D.H."},{"name":"Nguyen C.H."},{"name":"Mamitsuka H."}]},"pmid":"31510641","pmcid":"PMC6612897","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/BIOINFORMATICS/BTZ319"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Dai Hai Nguyen","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"hai@kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jp","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"owner":"Pub2Tools","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":[],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ADAPTIVE","biotoolsID":"ADAPTIVE","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-12-01T14:42:18Z","name":"ADAPTIVE","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"},{"term":"Machine learning","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3474"}],"additionDate":"2019-11-14T19:38:29Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://www.bic.kyoto-u.ac.jp/pathway/tools/ADAPTIVE"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[{"note":"ThermoRawFileParserGUI","type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/compomics/ThermoRawFileParserGUI"}],"description":"Open-source, crossplatform tool that converts Thermo RAW files into open file formats such as MGF and to the HUPO-PSI standard file format mzML","language":["Java","C#"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"https://github.com/compomics/ThermoRawFileParser/releases"}],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrum","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"MGF","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3651"},{"term":"mzML","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3244"}]}],"input":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrum","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"Thermo RAW","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3712"}]}],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Conversion","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3434"},{"term":"Filtering","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3695"},{"term":"Peak detection","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3215"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":null,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.1101/622852"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Division","name":"Computational Omics and Systems Biology Group","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"compomics.list@gmail.com","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["veits@bmb.sdu.dk"]},"owner":"hans","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://github.com/compomics/ThermoRawFileParser/blob/master/README.md"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":"Apache-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ThermoRawFileParser","biotoolsID":"ThermoRawFileParser","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-11-24T15:01:16Z","name":"ThermoRawFileParser","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"}],"additionDate":"2019-08-09T13:10:29Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/compomics/ThermoRawFileParser"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://bitbucket.org/veitveit/vsclust/src/master/"}],"description":"Feature-based variance-sensitive clustering of omics data.

Optimal clustering results yield groups of functionally related features that may include genes, proteins and metabolites in biological processes and molecular networks. Omics experiments typically include replicated measurements of each feature within a given condition to statistically assess featurespecific variation. Current clustering approaches ignore this variation by averaging, which often leads to incorrect cluster assignments. Results: We present VSClust that accounts for feature-specific variance. Based on an algorithm derived from fuzzy clustering, VSClust unifies statistical testing with pattern recognition to cluster the data into feature groups that more accurately reflect the underlying molecular and functional behavior. We apply VSClust to artificial and experimental datasets comprising hundreds to >80 000 features across 6-20 different conditions including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics experiments. VSClust avoids arbitrary averaging methods, outperforms standard fuzzy c-means clustering and simplifies the data analysis workflow in large-scale omics studies.","title":"VSClust: Feature-based variance-sensitive clustering of omics data","authors":[{"name":"Schwammle V."},{"name":"Jensen O.N."}]},"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bty224"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Veit SchwÃ¤mmle","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"veits@bmb.sdu.dk","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"veits@bmb.sdu.dk","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://bitbucket.org/veitveit/vsclust"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Web service"],"license":"GPL-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:vsclust","biotoolsID":"vsclust","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-10-15T08:27:11Z","name":"VSClust","topic":[{"term":"Genomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0622"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Omics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3391"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Statistics and probability","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2269"},{"term":"Data mining","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3473"}],"additionDate":"2018-06-02T07:03:53Z","collectionID":["Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://computproteomics.bmb.sdu.dk:8192/app_direct/VSClust/"},{"otherID":[{"type":"doi","value":"doi:10.25504/FAIRsharing.dk451a","version":null},{"type":"rrid","value":"rrid:SCR_015535","version":null}],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":"European MassBank site","type":["Service"],"url":"https://massbank.eu/"},{"note":null,"type":["Other"],"url":"https://github.com/MassBank/"}],"description":"MassBank is a public repository of mass spectra of small chemical compounds for life sciences (<3000 Da).

The main bottleneck in the interpretation of metabolite profiling or screening experiments is the identification of unknown compounds from tandem mass spectra. Spectral libraries for tandem MS, such as MassBank or NIST, contain reference spectra for many compounds, but their limited chemical coverage reduces the chance for a correct and reliable identification of unknown spectra outside the database domain. On the other hand, compound databases like PubChem or ChemSpider have a much larger coverage of the chemical space, but they cannot be queried with spectral information directly. Recently, computational mass spectrometry methods and in silico fragmentation prediction allow users to search such databases of chemical structures. We present a new strategy called MetFusion to combine identification results from several resources, in particular, from the in silico fragmenter MetFrag with the spectral library MassBank to improve compound identification. We evaluate the performance on a set of 1062 spectra and achieve an improved ranking of the correct compound from rank 28 using MetFrag alone, to rank 7 with MetFusion, even if the correct compound and similar compounds are absent from the spectral library. On the basis of the evaluation, we extrapolate the performance of MetFusion to the KEGG compound database.

Here, we present a novel approach to analyze metabolomics data from untargeted, data-independent LC-MS/MS measurements. By integrated analysis of MS1 abundances and MS/MS spectra, the identification of regulated metabolite families is achieved. This approach offers a global view on metabolic regulation in comparative metabolomics. We implemented our approach in the web application \"MetFamily\", which is freely available at http://msbi.ipb-halle.de/MetFamily/. MetFamily provides a dynamic link between the patterns based on MS1-signal intensity and the corresponding structural similarity at the MS/MS level. Structurally related metabolites are annotated as metabolite families based on a hierarchical cluster analysis of measured MS/MS spectra. Joint examination with principal component analysis of MS1 patterns, where this annotation is preserved in the loadings, facilitates the interpretation of comparative metabolomics data at the level of metabolite families. As a proof of concept, we identified two trichome-specific metabolite families from wild-type tomato Solanum habrochaites LA1777 in a fully unsupervised manner and validated our findings based on earlier publications and with NMR.","title":"Discovering regulated metabolite families in untargeted metabolomics studies","authors":[{"name":"Treutler H."},{"name":"Tsugawa H."},{"name":"Porzel A."},{"name":"Gorzolka K."},{"name":"Tissier A."},{"name":"Neumann S."},{"name":"Balcke G.U."}]},"pmid":"27452369","pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/acs.analchem.6b01569"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Treutler, Hendrik","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"hendrik.treutler@ipb-halle.de","url":"http://www.ipb-halle.de/suche/?tx_solr[q]=treutler&tx_solr[filter][0]=type%3Atx_avonisintranet_domain_model_employees","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["Treutler"]},"owner":"sneumann","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Emerging","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":"Is available in the 'About' tab of the web app (http://msbi.ipb-halle.de/MetFamily/) and as supplement of the publication.","type":["User manual"],"url":"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.analchem.6b01569"}],"community":null,"version":["1"],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":"Freeware","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:metfamily","biotoolsID":"metfamily","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-23T19:51:54Z","name":"MetFamily","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"}],"additionDate":"2017-04-13T11:46:05Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://msbi.ipb-halle.de/MetFamily/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[{"note":"Code and examples on Github","type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/seliv55/ramidcor"}],"description":"R-program supporting a step of workflow of fluxomic analysis of artificial 13C labeling of metabolites.

However, extracting such information requires special care, such as a correction for naturally occurring isotopes, or overlapping mass spectra of various components of the cell culture medium. Developing a method for a correction of overlapping peaks is the primary objective of this study. Results: Our computer program-MIDcor (free at https://github.com/seliv55/mid_correct) written in the R programming language, corrects the raw MS spectra both for the naturally occurring isotopes and for the overlapping of peaks corresponding to various substances. To this end, the mass spectra of unlabeled metabolites measured in two media are necessary: in a minimal medium containing only derivatized metabolites and chemicals for derivatization, and in a complete cell incubated medium. The MIDcor program calculates the difference (D) between the theoretical and experimentally measured spectra of metabolites containing only the naturally occurring isotopes. The result of comparison of D in the two media determines a way of deciphering the true spectra. (1) If D in the complete medium is greater than that in the minimal medium in at least one peak, then unchanged D is subtracted from the raw spectra of the labeled metabolite. (2) If D does not depend on the medium, then the spectrum probably overlaps with a derivatized fragment of the same metabolite, and D is modified proportionally to the metabolite labeling. The program automatically reaches a decision regarding the way of correction. For some metabolites/fragments in the case (2) D was found to decrease when the tested substance was 13C labeled, and this isotopic effect also can be corrected automatically, if the user provides a measured spectrum of the substance in which the 13C labeling is known a priori. Conclusion: Using the developed program improves the reliability of stable isotope tracer data analysis.","title":"MIDcor, an R-program for deciphering mass interferences in mass spectra of metabolites enriched in stable isotopes","authors":[{"name":"Selivanov V.A."},{"name":"Benito A."},{"name":"Miranda A."},{"name":"Aguilar E."},{"name":"Polat I.H."},{"name":"Centelles J.J."},{"name":"Jayaraman A."},{"name":"Lee P.W.N."},{"name":"Marin S."},{"name":"Cascante M."}]},"pmid":"28158972","pmcid":"PMC5291980","type":["Method"],"version":null,"doi":"10.1186/s12859-017-1513-3"}],"elixirNode":["Spain"],"elixirPlatform":["Tools"],"credit":[],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"vitaly","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":"contains usage instructions and examples","type":["General"],"url":"https://github.com/seliv55/ramidcor/"}],"community":null,"version":["0.0.1.0"],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":"Freeware","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:Midcor","biotoolsID":"Midcor","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:27Z","name":"Midcor","topic":[{"term":"Fluxomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3955"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"}],"additionDate":"2020-01-24T09:54:22Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/seliv55/ramidcor"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/seliv55/ramidcor"}],"description":"R-program supporting the initial step of the workflow of 13C assisted fluxomic analysis: extraction of mass spectra (MS) of 13C-labeled metabolites of interest from raw mass spectrometer recordings saved in NetCDF files.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":"0.0.1.0","url":"https://github.com/seliv55/ramidcor"}],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrum","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"TIDE TXT","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3835"}]}],"input":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrum","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0943"},"format":[{"term":"netCDF","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3650"}]},{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry data","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2536"},"format":[{"term":"Textual format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Data handling","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2409"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":0,"journal":"Methods in Molecular Biology","abstract":"Â© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.Stable isotope-resolved metabolomics (SIRM), based on the analysis of biological samples from living cells incubated with artificial isotope enriched substrates, enables mapping the rates of biochemical reactions (metabolic fluxes).

The COBRA Toolbox is a comprehensive desktop software suite of interoperable COBRA methods. It has found widespread application in biology, biomedicine, and biotechnology because its functions can be flexibly combined to implement tailored COBRA protocols for any biochemical network. This protocol is an update to the COBRA Toolbox v.1.0 and v.2.0. Version 3.0 includes new methods for quality-controlled reconstruction, modeling, topological analysis, strain and experimental design, and network visualization, as well as network integration of chemoinformatic, metabolomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and thermochemical data.

Quantitative applications in systems and synthetic biology require to correct the raw MS data for the contribution of naturally occurring isotopes. Several tools are available to correct low-resolution MS data, and recent developments made substantial improvements by introducing resolution-dependent correction methods, hence opening the way to the correction of high-resolution MS (HRMS) data. Nevertheless, current HRMS correction methods partly fail to determine which isotopic species are resolved from the tracer isotopologues and should thus be corrected. We present an updated version of our isotope correction software (IsoCor) with a novel correction algorithm which ensures to accurately exploit any chemical species with any isotopic tracer, at any MS resolution. IsoCor v2 also includes a novel graphical user interface for intuitive use by end-users and a command-line interface to streamline integration into existing pipelines.

However, a large proportion of the peaks consists of experimental noise and low abundance compounds are typically masked by noise peaks, compromising the quality of the data. In this paper, we propose a new measure of similarity between a pair of MS experiments, called truncated rank correlation (TRC). To provide a robust metric of similarity in noisy high-dimensional data, TRC uses truncated top ranks (or top m-ranks) for calculating correlation. A comprehensive numerical study suggests that TRC outperforms traditional sample correlation and Kendall's Ï. We apply TRC to measuring test-retest reliability of two MS experiments, including biological replicate analysis of the metabolome in HEK293 cells and metabolomic profiling of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients.

All rights reserved.For decades, researchers have lacked the ability to rapidly correlate microbial identity with bacterial metabolism. Since specialized metabolites are critical to bacterial function and survival in the environment, we designed a data acquisition and bioinformatics technique (IDBac) that utilizes in situ matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to analyze protein and specialized metabolite spectra recorded from single bacterial colonies picked from agar plates. We demonstrated the power of our approach by discriminating between two Bacillus subtilis strains in <30 min solely on the basis of their differential ability to produce cyclic peptide antibiotics surfactin and plipastatin, caused by a single frameshift mutation. Next, we used IDBac to detect subtle intraspecies differences in the production of metal scavenging acyl-desferrioxamines in a group of eight freshwater Micromonospora isolates that share >99% sequence similarity in the 16S rRNA gene. Finally, we used IDBac to simultaneously extract protein and specialized metabolite MS profiles from unidentified Lake Michigan sponge-associated bacteria isolated from an agar plate. In just 3 h, we created hierarchical protein MS groupings of 11 environmental isolates (10 MS replicates each, for a total of 110 spectra) that accurately mirrored phylogenetic groupings. We further distinguished isolates within these groupings, which share nearly identical 16S rRNA gene sequence identity, based on interspecies and intraspecies differences in specialized metabolite production. IDBac is an attempt to couple in situ MS analyses of protein content and specialized metabolite production to allow for facile discrimination of closely related bacterial colonies.","title":"Coupling MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry protein and specialized metabolite analyses to rapidly discriminate bacterial function","authors":[{"name":"Clark C.M."},{"name":"Costa M.S."},{"name":"Sanchez L.M."},{"name":"Murphy B.T."}]},"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.1073/pnas.1801247115"},{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2019-05-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":6,"journal":"Journal of Visualized Experiments","abstract":"Â© 2019 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.In order to visualize the relationship between bacterial phylogeny and specialized metabolite production of bacterial colonies growing on nutrient agar, we developed IDBac-a low-cost and high-throughput matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDITOF MS) bioinformatics pipeline.

Importantly, pyQms performs very well to accurately quantify partially labeled proteomes in large scale and high throughput, the most challenging task for a quantification algorithm.","title":"PyQms enables universal and accurate quantification of mass spectrometry data","authors":[{"name":"Leufken J."},{"name":"Niehues A."},{"name":"Sarin L.P."},{"name":"Wessel F."},{"name":"Hippler M."},{"name":"Leidel S.A."},{"name":"Fufezan C."}]},"pmid":"28729385","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1074/mcp.M117.068007"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["fu","JL-MS","StSchulze","proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"fu","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://pyqms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":"MIT","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pyQms","biotoolsID":"pyQms","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:25Z","name":"pyQms","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"}],"additionDate":"2019-08-23T13:36:16Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/pyQms/pyqms"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[],"description":"Analysis and Performance Assessment of Label-free Proteome Quantification.","language":[],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Label-free quantification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3634"},{"term":"iTRAQ","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3639"},{"term":"SILAC","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3638"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","citationCount":53,"journal":"Briefings in Bioinformatics","abstract":"Â© 2019 The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Label-free quantification (LFQ) with a specific and sequentially integrated workflow of acquisition technique, quantification tool and processing method has emerged as the popular technique employed in metaproteomic research to provide a comprehensive landscape of the adaptive response of microbes to external stimuli and their interactions with other organisms or host cells. The performance of a specific LFQ workflow is highly dependent on the studied data. Hence, it is essential to discover the most appropriate one for a specific data set. However, it is challenging to perform such discovery due to the large number of possible workflows and the multifaceted nature of the evaluation criteria. Herein, a web server ANPELA (https://idrblab.org/anpela/) was developed and validated as the first tool enabling performance assessment of whole LFQ workflow (collective assessment by five well-established criteria with distinct underlying theories), and it enabled the identification of the optimal LFQ workflow(s) by a comprehensive performance ranking. ANPELA not only automatically detects the diverse formats of data generated by all quantification tools but also provides the most complete set of processing methods among the available web servers and stand-alone tools. Systematic validation using metaproteomic benchmarks revealed ANPELA's capabilities in 1 discovering well-performing workflow(s), (2) enabling assessment from multiple perspectives and (3) validating LFQ accuracy using spiked proteins. ANPELA has a unique ability to evaluate the performance of whole LFQ workflow and enables the discovery of the optimal LFQs by the comprehensive performance ranking of all 560 workflows. Therefore, it has great potential for applications in metaproteomic and other studies requiring LFQ techniques, as many features are shared among proteomic studies.","title":"ANPELA: Analysis and performance assessment of the label-free quantification workflow for metaproteomic studies","authors":[{"name":"Tang J."},{"name":"Fu J."},{"name":"Wang Y."},{"name":"Li B."},{"name":"Li Y."},{"name":"Yang Q."},{"name":"Cui X."},{"name":"Hong J."},{"name":"Li X."},{"name":"Chen Y."},{"name":"Xue W."},{"name":"Zhu F."}]},"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/bib/bby127"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Jing Tang","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"tangj@cqu.edu.cn","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Jianbo Fu","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"fujianbo@zju.edu.cn","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Yunxia Wang","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"lfwyx@zju.edu.cn","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Feng Zhu","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"zhufeng@zju.edu.cn","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"hans","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":"Tutorial material","type":["Training material"],"url":"http://idrblab.cn/anpela/"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":"Unlicense","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ANPELA","biotoolsID":"ANPELA","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:25Z","name":"ANPELA","topic":[{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Metagenomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3174"}],"additionDate":"2019-08-09T13:24:05Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://idrblab.cn/anpela/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[],"description":"Whole-genome annotation and functional analyses based on RNA expression data.","language":[],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Enrichment analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3501"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":10,"journal":"Plant Journal","abstract":"Â© 2019 The Authors. The Plant Journal published by Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons LtdCarbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) catalyze the formation and modification of glycoproteins, glycolipids, starch, secondary metabolites and cell wall biopolymers. They are key enzymes for the biosynthesis of food and renewable biomass. Woody biomass is particularly important for long-term carbon storage and as an abundant renewable natural resource for many industrial applications. This study presents a re-annotation of CAZyme genes in the current Populus trichocarpa genome assembly and in silico functional characterization, based on high-resolution RNA-Seq data sets. Altogether, 1914 CAZyme and expansin genes were annotated in 101 families. About 1797 of these genes were found expressed in at least one Populus organ. We identified genes involved in the biosynthesis of different cell wall polymers and their paralogs. Whereas similar families exist in poplar and Arabidopsis thaliana (with the exception of CBM13 found only in poplar), a few families had significantly different copy numbers between the two species. To identify the transcriptional coordination and functional relatedness within the CAZymes and other proteins, we performed co-expression network analysis of CAZymes in wood-forming tissues using the AspWood database (http://aspwood.popgenie.org/aspwood-v3.0/) for Populus tremula. This provided an overview of the transcriptional changes in CAZymes during the transition from primary to secondary wall formation, and the clustering of transcripts into potential regulons. Candidate enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of polysaccharides were identified along with many tissue-specific uncharacterized genes and transcription factors. These collections offer a rich source of targets for the modification of secondary cell wall biosynthesis and other developmental processes in woody plants.","title":"Poplar carbohydrate-active enzymes: whole-genome annotation and functional analyses based on RNA expression data","authors":[{"name":"Kumar V."},{"name":"Hainaut M."},{"name":"Delhomme N."},{"name":"Mannapperuma C."},{"name":"Immerzeel P."},{"name":"Street N.R."},{"name":"Henrissat B."},{"name":"Mellerowicz E.J."}]},"pmid":"31111606","pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.1111/TPJ.14417"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Ewa Mellerowicz","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"ewa.mellerowicz@slu.se","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"hans","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":"Unlicense","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:AspWood","biotoolsID":"AspWood","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:25Z","name":"AspWood","topic":[{"term":"Plant biology","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0780"},{"term":"Carbohydrates","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0152"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"}],"additionDate":"2019-08-09T13:16:04Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://aspwood.popgenie.org/aspwood-v3.0/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[],"description":"Dynamic Retention Time Database for Steroidomics.","language":[],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Downloads page","version":null,"url":"https://dynasti.vital-it.ch/#/download"}],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Phasing","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3454"},{"term":"Retention time prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3633"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2019-05-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":11,"journal":"Metabolites","abstract":"Â© 2019 by the authors.Steroidomics studies face the challenge of separating analytical compounds with very similar structures (i.e., isomers). Liquid chromatography (LC) is commonly used to this end, but the shared core structure of this family of compounds compromises effective separations among the numerous chemical analytes with comparable physico-chemical properties. Careful tuning of the mobile phase gradient and an appropriate choice of the stationary phase can be used to overcome this problem, in turn modifying the retention times in different ways for each compound. In the usual workflow, this approach is suboptimal for the annotation of features based on retention times since it requires characterizing a library of known compounds for every fine-tuned configuration. We introduce a software solution, DynaStI, that is capable of annotating liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS) features by dynamically generating the retention times from a database containing intrinsic properties of a library of metabolites. DynaStI uses the well-established linear solvent strength (LSS) model for reversed-phase LC. Given a list of LC\u2013MS features and some characteristics of the LC setup, this software computes the corresponding retention times for the internal database and then annotates the features using the exact masses with predicted retention times at the working conditions. DynaStI (https://dynasti.vital-it.ch) is able to automatically calibrate its predictions to compensate for deviations in the input parameters. The database also includes identification and structural information for each annotation, such as IUPAC name, CAS number, SMILES string, metabolic pathways, and links to external metabolomic or lipidomic databases.","title":"DynaStI: A dynamic retention time database for steroidomics","authors":[{"name":"Codesido S."},{"name":"Randazzo G.M."},{"name":"Lehmann F."},{"name":"Gonzalez-Ruiz V."},{"name":"Garcia A."},{"name":"Xenarios I."},{"name":"Liechti R."},{"name":"Bridge A."},{"name":"Boccard J."},{"name":"Rudaz S."}]},"pmid":"31052310","pmcid":"PMC6572260","type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.3390/METABO9050085"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3669-6313","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Santiago Codesido","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"Santiago.Codesido@unige.ch","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"hans","cost":"Free of charge (with restrictions)","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://dynasti.vital-it.ch/#/about"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":"Unlicense","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:DynaStI","biotoolsID":"DynaStI","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:25Z","name":"DynaStI","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Lipids","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0153"},{"term":"Compound libraries and screening","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3343"}],"additionDate":"2019-08-09T13:10:21Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://dynasti.vital-it.ch"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[],"description":"Metabolomics-Driven Exploration of the Chemical Drug Space to Predict Combination Antimicrobial Therapies.","language":[],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Antimicrobial resistance prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3482"},{"term":"Deisotoping","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3629"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2019-06-20T00:00:00Z","citationCount":19,"journal":"Molecular Cell","abstract":"Â© 2019 The Author(s)Alternative to the conventional search for single-target, single-compound treatments, combination therapies can open entirely new opportunities to fight antibiotic resistance.

All rights reserved.Motivation: One of the main goals in systems biology is to learn molecular regulatory networks from quantitative profile data. In particular, Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) are widely used network models in bioinformatics where variables (e.g. transcripts, metabolites or proteins) are represented by nodes, and pairs of nodes are connected with an edge according to their partial correlation. Reconstructing a GGM from data is a challenging task when the sample size is smaller than the number of variables. The main problem consists in finding the inverse of the covariance estimator which is ill-conditioned in this case. Shrinkage-based covariance estimators are a popular approach, producing an invertible 'shrunk' covariance. However, a proper significance test for the 'shrunk' partial correlation (i.e. the GGM edges) is an open challenge as a probability density including the shrinkage is unknown. In this article, we present (i) a geometric reformulation of the shrinkage-based GGM, and (ii) a probability density that naturally includes the shrinkage parameter. Results: Our results show that the inference using this new 'shrunk' probability density is as accurate as Monte Carlo estimation (an unbiased non-parametric method) for any shrinkage value, while being computationally more efficient. We show on synthetic data how the novel test for significance allows an accurate control of the Type I error and outperforms the network reconstruction obtained by the widely used R package GeneNet. This is further highlighted in two gene expression datasets from stress response in Eschericha coli, and the effect of influenza infection in Mus musculus.","title":"Exact hypothesis testing for shrinkage-based Gaussian graphical models","authors":[{"name":"Bernal V."},{"name":"Bischoff R."},{"name":"Guryev V."},{"name":"Grzegorczyk M."},{"name":"Horvatovich P."}]},"pmid":"31077287","pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/BIOINFORMATICS/BTZ357"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Peter Horvatovich","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"p.l.horvatovich@rug.nl","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"hans","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://github.com/V-Bernal/GGM-Shrinkage/blob/master/README.md"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Script"],"license":"Unlicense","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:GGMs","biotoolsID":"GGMs","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:25Z","name":"GGMs","topic":[{"term":"Statistics and probability","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2269"},{"term":"Molecular interactions, pathways and networks","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0602"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"}],"additionDate":"2019-08-09T13:22:01Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/V-Bernal/GGM-Shrinkage"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[{"note":null,"type":["Issue tracker"],"url":"https://github.com/kwanjeeraw/lmm2met/issues"}],"description":"Linear mixed-effects modeling to improve clinical metabolomics information.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Essential dynamics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3891"},{"term":"Natural product identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3803"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":5,"journal":"Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal","abstract":"Â© 2019 The AuthorsMetabolite profiles from biological samples suffer from both technical variations and subject-specific variants. To improve the quality of metabolomics data, conventional data processing methods can be employed to remove technical variations. These methods do not consider sources of subject variation as separate factors from biological factors of interest. This can be a significant issue when performing quantitative metabolomics in clinical trials or screening for a potential biomarker in early-stage disease, because changes in metabolism or a desired-metabolite signal are small compared to the total metabolite signals. As a result, inter-individual variability can interfere subsequent statistical analyses. Here, we propose an additional data processing step using linear mixed-effects modelling to readjust an individual metabolite signal prior to multivariate analyses. Published clinical metabolomics data was used to demonstrate and evaluate the proposed method. We observed a substantial reduction in variation of each metabolite signal after model fitting.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a widely used and sensitive technique for obtaining structural information of complex mixtures. However, just knowing the molecular masses of the mixture's constituents is almost always insufficient for confident assignment of the associated chemical structures. Structural information can be augmented through MS fragmentation experiments whereby detected metabolites are fragmented, giving rise to MS/MS spectra. However, how can we maximize the structural information we gain from fragmentation spectra? We recently proposed a substructure-based strategy to enhance metabolite annotation for complex mixtures by considering metabolites as the sum of (bio)chemically relevant moieties that we can detect through mass spectrometry fragmentation approaches. Our MS2LDA tool allows us to discover-unsupervised-groups of mass fragments and/or neutral losses, termed Mass2Motifs, that often correspond to substructures. After manual annotation, these Mass2Motifs can be used in subsequent MS2LDA analyses of new datasets, thereby providing structural annotations for many molecules that are not present in spectral databases. Here, we describe how additional strategies, taking advantage of (i) combinatorial in silico matching of experimental mass features to substructures of candidate molecules, and (ii) automated machine learning classification of molecules, can facilitate semi-automated annotation of substructures. We show how our approach accelerates the Mass2Motif annotation process and therefore broadens the chemical space spanned by characterized motifs. Our machine learning model used to classify fragmentation spectra learns the relationships between fragment spectra and chemical features. Classification prediction on these features can be aggregated for all molecules that contribute to a particular Mass2Motif and guide Mass2Motif annotations. To make annotated Mass2Motifs available to the community, we also present MotifDB: an open database of Mass2Motifs that can be browsed and accessed programmatically through an Application Programming Interface (API). MotifDB is integrated within ms2lda.org, allowing users to efficiently search for characterized motifs in their own experiments. We expect that with an increasing number of Mass2Motif annotations available through a growing database, we can more quickly gain insight into the constituents of complex mixtures. This will allow prioritization towards novel or unexpected chemistries and faster recognition of known biochemical building blocks.","title":"Deciphering complex metabolite mixtures by unsupervised and supervised substructure discovery and semi-automated annotation from MS/MS spectra","authors":[{"name":"Rogers S."},{"name":"Ong C.W."},{"name":"Wandy J."},{"name":"Ernst M."},{"name":"Ridder L."},{"name":"Van Der Hooft J.J.J."}]},"pmid":"31120050","pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.1039/C8FD00235E"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"hans","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://ms2lda.org/user_guide/"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":"GPL-3.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:MS2LDA","biotoolsID":"MS2LDA","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:25Z","name":"MS2LDA","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"}],"additionDate":"2019-08-09T13:13:48Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://ms2lda.org"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[{"note":null,"type":["Issue tracker"],"url":"https://github.com/LlucSF/rMSIKeyIon/issues"}],"description":"Ion Filtering R Package for Untargeted Analysis of Metabolomic LDI-MS Images.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Enrichment analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3501"},{"term":"Parsing","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_1812"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":2,"journal":"Metabolites","abstract":"Â© 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Many MALDI-MS imaging experiments make a case versus control studies of different tissue regions in order to highlight significant compounds affected by the variables of study. This is a challenge because the tissue samples to be compared come from different biological entities, and therefore they exhibit high variability. Moreover, the statistical tests available cannot properly compare ion concentrations in two regions of interest (ROIs) within or between images. The high correlation between the ion concentrations due to the existence of different morphological regions in the tissue means that the common statistical tests used in metabolomics experiments cannot be applied. Another difficulty with the reliability of statistical tests is the elevated number of undetected MS ions in a high percentage of pixels. In this study, we report a procedure for discovering the most important ions in the comparison of a pair of ROIs within or between tissue sections. These ROIs were identified by an unsupervised segmentation process, using the popular k-means algorithm. Our ion filtering algorithm aims to find the up or down-regulated ions between two ROIs by using a combination of three parameters: (a) the percentage of pixels in which a particular ion is not detected, (b) the Mann\u2013Whitney U ion concentration test, and (c) the ion concentration fold-change. The undetected MS signals (null peaks) are discarded from the histogram before the calculation of (b) and (c) parameters. With this methodology, we found the important ions between the different segments of a mouse brain tissue sagittal section and determined some lipid compounds (mainly triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines) in the liver of mice exposed to thirdhand smoke.","title":"RMsikeyion: An ion filtering r package for untargeted analysis of metabolomic LDI-MS images","authors":[{"name":"Del Castillo E."},{"name":"Semente L."},{"name":"Torres S."},{"name":"Rafols P."},{"name":"Ramirez N."},{"name":"Martins-Green M."},{"name":"Santafe M."},{"name":"Correig X."}]},"pmid":"31382415","pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.3390/metabo9080162"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Esteban del Castillo","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"esteban.delcastillo@urv.cat","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Ruta","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://github.com/LlucSF/rMSIKeyIon/blob/master/README.md"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Library"],"license":"GPL-3.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:rMSIKeyIon","biotoolsID":"rMSIKeyIon","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:24Z","name":"rMSIKeyIon","topic":[{"term":"Statistics and probability","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2269"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2019-08-11T08:45:33Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/LlucSF/rMSIKeyIon"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[{"note":"Python package","type":["Other"],"url":"https://pypi.org/project/multiview/"},{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/mariceli3/multiview"},{"note":null,"type":["Issue tracker"],"url":"https://github.com/mariceli3/multiview/issues"}],"description":"Software package for multiview pattern recognition methods.","language":["R","Python"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":"Multiview package for R","type":"Software package","version":null,"url":"http://b2slab.upc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/multiview_0.1.0.tar.gz"},{"note":"Multiview package for Python","type":"Software package","version":null,"url":"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/multiview"}],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Clustering","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3432"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2019-08-15T00:00:00Z","citationCount":2,"journal":"Bioinformatics","abstract":"Â© 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

Multiview data are gathered from several experiments, measurements or feature sets available for the same subjects. Recent studies in pattern recognition have shown the advantage of using multiview methods of clustering and dimensionality reduction; however, none of these methods are readily available to the extent of our knowledge. Multiview extensions of four well-known pattern recognition methods are proposed here. Three multiview dimensionality reduction methods: multiview t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding, multiview multidimensional scaling and multiview minimum curvilinearity embedding, as well as a multiview spectral clustering method. Often they produce better results than their single-view counterparts, tested here on four multiview datasets.","title":"Multiview: A software package for multiview pattern recognition methods","authors":[{"name":"Kanaan-Izquierdo S."},{"name":"Ziyatdinov A."},{"name":"Burgueno M.A."},{"name":"Perera-Lluna A."}]},"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bty1039"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Samir Kanaan-Izquierdo","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"samir.kanaan@upc.edu","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":null,"name":"MarÃ­a Araceli BurgueÃ±o Caballero","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"mburgueno@uoc.edu","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Ruta","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Emerging","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://b2slab.upc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mv-vignette.html"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Library"],"license":"BSD-4-Clause","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:multiview","biotoolsID":"multiview","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:24Z","name":"multiview","topic":[{"term":"Data mining","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3473"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"}],"additionDate":"2019-07-11T09:00:12Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://b2slab.upc.edu/software-and-tutorials/multiview-package-multiview-clustering-dimensionality-reduction-methods/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[{"note":null,"type":["Issue tracker"],"url":"http://github.com/ressomlab/INDEED/issues"},{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"https://github.com/ressomlab/INDEED"}],"description":"R package for network based differential expression analysis.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[{"biotoolsID":"R","type":"uses"}],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Expression correlation analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3463"},{"term":"Differential protein expression analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3741"},{"term":"Weighted correlation network analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3766"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2019-01-21T00:00:00Z","citationCount":3,"journal":"Proceedings - 2018 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine, BIBM 2018","abstract":"Â© 2018 IEEE.With recent advancement of omics technologies, fueled by decreased cost and increased number of available datasets, computational methods for differential expression analysis are sought to identify disease-associated biomolecules. Conventional differential expression analysis methods (e.g. student's t-test, ANOVA) focus on assessing mean and variance of biomolecules in each biological group. On the other hand, network-based approaches take into account the interactions between biomolecules in choosing differentially expressed ones. These interactions are typically evaluated by correlation methods that tend to generate over-complicated networks due to many seemingly indirect associations. In this paper, we introduce a new R/Bioconductor package INDEED that allows users to construct a sparse network based on partial correlation, and to identify biomolecules that have significant changes both at individual expression and pairwise interaction levels. We applied INDEED for analysis of two omic datasets acquired in a cancer biomarker discovery study to help rank disease-associated biomolecules. We believe biomolecules selected by INDEED lead to improved sensitivity and specificity in detecting disease status compared to those selected by conventional statistical methods. Also, INDEED's framework is amenable to further expansion to integrate networks from multi-omic studies, thereby allowing selection of reliable disease-associated biomolecules or disease biomarkers.","title":"INDEED: R package for network based differential expression analysis","authors":[{"name":"Li Z."},{"name":"Zuo Y."},{"name":"Xu C."},{"name":"Varghese R.S."},{"name":"Ressom H.W."}]},"pmid":"31179159","pmcid":"PMC6549230","type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2018.8621426"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Zhenzhi Li","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"zzrickli@gmail.com","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact","Maintainer","Developer"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Yiming Zuo","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"yimingzuo@gmail.com","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact","Maintainer"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Ruta","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://github.com/ressomlab/INDEED/blob/master/vignettes/Introduction_to_INDEED.html"}],"community":null,"version":["1.2.0"],"toolType":["Library"],"license":"Artistic-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:INDEED","biotoolsID":"INDEED","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:24Z","name":"INDEED","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Biomarkers","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3360"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"}],"additionDate":"2019-06-20T12:38:34Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/INDEED.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[],"description":"R package for similarity-based clustering of tandem mass spectra to aid feature annotation in metabolomics.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[{"biotoolsID":"R","type":"uses"}],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Visualisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0337"},{"term":"Natural product identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3803"},{"term":"Mass spectra calibration","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3627"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":3,"journal":"Bioinformatics","abstract":"Â© 2019 The Author(s).Compound identification is one of the most eminent challenges in the untargeted analysis of complex mixtures of small molecules by mass spectrometry.

In contrast to targeted methods that are dedicated to specific features, global profiling acquisition methods allow new unspecific metabolites to be analyzed. The challenge with these so-called untargeted methods is the proper and automated extraction and integration of features that could be of relevance. We propose a new algorithm that enables untargeted integration of samples that are measured with high resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In contrast to other approaches limited user interaction is needed allowing also less experienced users to integrate their data. The large amount of single features that are found within a sample is combined to a smaller list of, compound-related, grouped feature-sets representative for that sample. These feature-sets allow for easier interpretation and identification and as important, easier matching over samples. We show that the automatic obtained integration results for a set of known target metabolites match those generated with vendor software but that at least 10 times more feature-sets are extracted as well. We demonstrate our approach using high resolution LC-MS data acquired for 128 samples on a lipidomics platform. The data was also processed in a targeted manner (with a combination of automatic and manual integration) using vendor software for a set of 174 targets. As our untargeted extraction procedure is run per sample and per mass trace the implementation of it is scalable. Because of the generic approach, we envision that this data extraction lipids method will be used in a targeted as well as untargeted analysis of many different kinds of TOF-MS data, even CE- and GC-MS data or MRM. The Matlab package is available for download on request and efforts are directed toward a user-friendly Windows executable.

Here, we introduce LipiDex, a freely available software suite that unifies and automates all stages of lipid identification, reducing hands-on processing time from hours to minutes for even the most expansive datasets. LipiDex utilizes flexible in silico fragmentation templates and lipid-optimized MS/MS spectral matching routines to confidently identify and track hundreds of lipid species and unknown compounds from diverse sample matrices. Unique spectral and chromatographic peak purity algorithms accurately quantify co-isolation and co-elution of isobaric lipids, generating identifications that match the structural resolution afforded by the LC-MS/MS experiment. During final data filtering, ionization artifacts are removed to significantly reduce dataset redundancy. LipiDex interfaces with several LC-MS/MS software packages, enabling robust lipid identification to be readily incorporated into pre-existing data workflows.

Different LC-MS data analysis packages have been developed in the last few years to facilitate this analysis. However, most of these strategies involve chromatographic alignment and peak shaping and often associate each \"feature\" (i.e., chromatographic peak) with a unique m/z measurement. Thus, the development of an alternative data analysis strategy that is applicable to most types of MS datasets and properly addresses these issues is still a challenge in the metabolomics field. Results: Here, we present an alternative approach called ROIMCR to: i) filter and compress massive LC-MS datasets while transforming their original structure into a data matrix of features without losing relevant information through the search of regions of interest (ROIs) in the m/z domain and ii) resolve compressed data to identify their contributing pure components without previous alignment or peak shaping by applying a Multivariate Curve Resolution-Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) analysis. In this study, the basics of the ROIMCR method are presented in detail and a detailed description of its implementation is also provided. Data were analyzed using the MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., www.mathworks.com) programming and computing environment. The application of the ROIMCR methodology is described in detail, with an example of LC-MS data generated in a lipidomic study and with other examples of recent applications. Conclusions: The methodology presented here combines the benefits of data filtering and compression based on the searching of ROI features, without the loss of spectral accuracy. The method has the benefits of the application of the powerful MCR-ALS data resolution method without the necessity of performing chromatographic peak alignment or modelling. The presented method is a powerful alternative to other existing data analysis approaches that do not use the MCR-ALS method to resolve LC-MS data. The ROIMCR method also represents an improved strategy compared to the direct applications of the MCR-ALS method that use less-powerful data compression strategies such as binning and windowing. Overall, the strategy presented here confirms the usefulness of the ROIMCR chemometrics method for analyzing LC-MS untargeted metabolomics data.","title":"ROIMCR: A powerful analysis strategy for LC-MS metabolomic datasets","authors":[{"name":"Gorrochategui E."},{"name":"Jaumot J."},{"name":"Tauler R."}]},"pmid":"31101001","pmcid":"PMC6525397","type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.1186/s12859-019-2848-8"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"RomÃ  Tauler","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"rtaqam@idaea.csic.es","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Ruta","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"https://protocolexchange.researchsquare.com/article/nprot-4347/v1"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":"Unlicense","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ROIMCR","biotoolsID":"ROIMCR","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:23Z","name":"ROIMCR","topic":[{"term":"Lipids","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0153"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Biomarkers","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3360"}],"additionDate":"2019-07-04T08:00:17Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://mcrals.wordpress.com/download/roimcr/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[],"description":"Portal designed to provide a comprehensive gene list annotation and analysis resource for experimental biologists.","language":[],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Enrichment analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3501"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":1585,"journal":"Nature Communications","abstract":"Â© 2019, The Author(s).A critical component in the interpretation of systems-level studies is the inference of enriched biological pathways and protein complexes contained within OMICs datasets.

Annotating these features is of the utmost importance for answering questions as fundamental as, e.g. how many metabolites are there in a given sample.Results: Here, we introduce CliqueMS, a new algorithm for annotating in-source LC-MS1 data. CliqueMS is based on the similarity between coelution profiles and therefore, as opposed to most methods, allows for the annotation of a single spectrum. Furthermore, CliqueMS improves upon the state of the art in several dimensions: (i) it uses a more discriminatory feature similarity metric; (ii) it treats the similarities between features in a transparent way by means of a simple generativemodel; (iii) it uses a well-grounded maximum likelihood inference approach to group features; (iv) it uses empirical adduct frequencies to identify the parental mass and (v) it deals more flexibly with the identification of the parental mass by proposing and ranking alternative annotations. We validate our approach with simple mixtures of standards and with real complex biological samples. CliqueMS reduces the thousands of features typically obtained in complex samples to hundreds of metabolites, and it is able to correctly annotate more metabolites and adducts from a single spectrum than available tools.","title":"CliqueMS: A computational tool for annotating in-source metabolite ions from LC-MS untargeted metabolomics data based on a coelution similarity network","authors":[{"name":"Senan O."},{"name":"Aguilar-Mogas A."},{"name":"Navarro M."},{"name":"Capellades J."},{"name":"Noon L."},{"name":"Burks D."},{"name":"Yanes O."},{"name":"Guimera R."},{"name":"Sales-Pardo M."}]},"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btz207"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Oriol Senan","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"oriol.senan@urv.cat","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Ruta","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":"Tutorial material","type":["Training material"],"url":"https://github.com/osenan/cliqueMS/blob/master/vignettes/annotate_features.Rmd"}],"community":null,"version":["0.3.2"],"toolType":["Library"],"license":"GPL-3.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:CliqueMS","biotoolsID":"CliqueMS","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:23Z","name":"CliqueMS","topic":[{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2019-07-04T14:05:39Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/osenan/cliqueMS"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Restricted access","link":[{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/RonanDaly/pimp"},{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/RonanDaly/pimp/issues"}],"description":"PiMP my metabolome: an integrated, web-based tool for LC-MS metabolomics data.","language":["JavaScript","Python"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Natural product identification","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3803"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2017-12-15T00:00:00Z","citationCount":17,"journal":"Bioinformatics","abstract":"Â© The Author 2017.

This stresses the need for efficient ways of integrating these data in a coherent description of biological systems. In many cases, biological data needs organization before integration. This is not seldom a collaborative effort, and it is thus important that tools for data integration support a collaborative way of working. Wiki systems with support for structured semantic data authoring, such as Semantic MediaWiki, provide a powerful solution for collaborative editing of data combined with machine-readability, so that data can be handled in an automated fashion in any downstream analyses. Semantic MediaWiki lacks a built-in data import function though, which hinders efficient round-tripping of data between interoperable Semantic Web formats such as RDF and the internal wiki format. Results: To solve this deficiency, the RDFIO suite of tools is presented, which supports importing of RDF data into Semantic MediaWiki, with metadata needed to export it again in the same RDF format, or ontology. Additionally, the new functionality enables mash-ups of automated data imports combined with manually created data presentations. The application of the suite of tools is demonstrated by importing drug discovery related data about rare diseases from Orphanet and acid dissociation constants from Wikidata. The RDFIO suite of tools is freely available for download via pharmb.io/project/rdfio. Conclusions: Through a set of biomedical demonstrators, it is demonstrated how the new functionality enables a number of usage scenarios where the interoperability of SMW and the wider Semantic Web is leveraged for biomedical data sets, to create an easy to use and flexible platform for exploring and working with biomedical data.","title":"RDFIO: Extending Semantic MediaWiki for interoperable biomedical data management","authors":[{"name":"Lampa S."},{"name":"Willighagen E."},{"name":"Kohonen P."},{"name":"King A."},{"name":"Vrandecic D."},{"name":"Grafstrom R."},{"name":"Spjuth O."}]},"pmid":"28870259","pmcid":"PMC5584330","type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.1186/s13326-017-0136-y"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":null,"name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":null,"url":"https://github.com/rdfio/RDFIO/issues","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Ruta","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://github.com/rdfio/RDFIO"},{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:RDFIO"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["SPARQL endpoint"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:RDFIO","biotoolsID":"RDFIO","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:23Z","name":"RDFIO","topic":[{"term":"Rare diseases","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3325"},{"term":"Data management","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3071"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"}],"additionDate":"2019-05-11T06:09:25Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://pharmb.io/project/rdfio/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[],"description":"R Package for Multiple Isotope Labeling Assisted Metabolomics Data Analysis.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"function":[],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2019-09-15T00:00:00Z","citationCount":5,"journal":"Bioinformatics","abstract":"Â© 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

With high throughput technologies increasing the scope of biological discoveries, the field of phenomics has been developing rapid and precise methods to collect, catalog, and analyze phenotypes. Such methods have allowed phenotypic data to be widely used in medical applications, from assisting clinical diagnoses to prioritizing genomic diagnoses. To channel the benefits of phenomics into the field of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), we have recently launched IEMbase, an expert-curated knowledgebase of IEM and their disease-characterizing phenotypes. While our efforts with IEMbase have realized benefits, taking full advantage of phenomics requires a comprehensive curation of IEM phenotypes in core phenomics projects, which is dependent upon contributions from the IEM clinical and research community. Here, we assess the inclusion of IEM biochemical phenotypes in a core phenomics project, the Human Phenotype Ontology. We then demonstrate the utility of biochemical phenotypes using a text-based phenomics method to predict gene-disease relationships, showing that the prediction of IEM genes is significantly better using biochemical rather than clinical profiles.

In contrast to LC-MS however, NMR data is predominantly being processed with commercial software. Meanwhile its data processing remains tedious and dependent on user interventions. As a follow-up to speaq, a previously released workflow for NMR spectral alignment and quantitation, we present speaq 2.0. This completely revised framework to automatically analyze 1D NMR spectra uses wavelets to efficiently summarize the raw spectra with minimal information loss or user interaction. The tool offers a fast and easy workflow that starts with the common approach of peak-picking, followed by grouping, thus avoiding the binning step.

As a follow-up to speaq, a previously released workflow for NMR spectral alignment and quantitation, we present speaq 2.0. This completely revised framework to automatically analyze 1D NMR spectra uses wavelets to efficiently summarize the raw spectra with minimal information loss or user interaction.

Therefore, it has become commonplace in a wide variety of disciplines and there is an intense need for development of software suites that provide the user with a less complicated and invalid analysis. These suites must integrate meta-analysis, a standardized data normalization method and a safe repository for all types of biological samples. In the case of the Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics, due to the complexity of the analysis, multiple procedures that are essential for the metabolite identification require special manipulation. Moreover, metabolomic analysis produces a vast amount of unidentified compound data, so there is a need for unknown peak identification methods. While a number of tools offer access to datasets, constantly providing new releases for data processing and the fact that considerable progress has been made in that area, there is no computational platform that emerges as a standardized approach which includes specialized normalization methods for GC-MS metabolomic analysis and incorporates the metabolic network analysis into data interpretation and unknown peak identification. To address these issues, as the datasets obtained from metabolomics experiments still remain extremely large and dense, we have implemented M-IOLITE, a computational suite for the efficient and automatic analysis of high-throughput metabolomic experiments. The aim of the suite is to streamline GC-MS metabolomic data analysis and to reduce complexity enabling the use of a friendly interface for processing, validating and annotating data. It integrates specialized normalization methods, a safe data repository and a peak library providing through its pipeline a useful tool which enables rapid and accurate analysis of the metabolomic profiles into an interactive system.","title":"Streamlining GC-MS metabolomic analysis using the M-IOLITE software suite","authors":[{"name":"Maga-Nteve C."},{"name":"Klapa M.I."}]},"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.12.140"}],"elixirNode":["Greece"],"elixirPlatform":["Tools"],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Maria I Klapa","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"mklapa@iceht.forth.gr","url":"http://miolite2.iceht.forth.gr","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"mklapa","cost":null,"maturity":"Emerging","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":"Web site with citation information, information about downloading and contacting developers","type":["General"],"url":"http://miolite2.iceht.forth.gr"}],"community":null,"version":["1.0"],"toolType":["Desktop application","Workflow","Database portal","Suite"],"license":"Other","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:m-iolite","biotoolsID":"m-iolite","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:21Z","name":"M-IOLITE","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Data submission, annotation and curation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0219"},{"term":"Data identity and mapping","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3345"},{"term":"Data quality management","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3572"},{"term":"Systems biology","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2259"},{"term":"Biochemistry","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3292"},{"term":"Chemical biology","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3369"},{"term":"Structure analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0081"},{"term":"Biochemistry","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3292"},{"term":"Statistics and probability","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2269"},{"term":"Experimental design and studies","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3678"}],"additionDate":"2017-09-11T12:07:35Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://miolite2.iceht.forth.gr"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[],"description":"A systems biology tool for analyzing metabolomic data.

The automation of the sample acquisition and subsequent analysis in high-throughput instruments that are capable of measuring metabolites is posing a challenge on the necessary systematic storage and computational processing of the experimental datasets. Whereas a multitude of specialized software systems for individual instruments and preprocessing methods exists, there is clearly a need for a free and platform-independent system that allows the standardized and integrated storage and analysis of data obtained from metabolomics experiments. Currently there exists no such system that on the one hand supports preprocessing of raw datasets but also allows to visualize and integrate the results of higher level statistical analyses within a functional genomics context. Results: To facilitate the systematic storage, analysis and integration of metabolomics experiments, we have implemented MeltDB, a web-based software platform for the analysis and annotation of datasets from metabolomics experiments. MeltDB supports open file formats (netCDF, mzXML, mzDATA) and facilitates the integration and evaluation of existing preprocessing methods. The system provides researchers with means to consistently describe and store their experimental datasets. Comprehensive analysis and visualization features of metabolomics datasets are offered to the community through a web-based user interface. The system covers the process from raw data to the visualization of results in a knowledge-based background and is integrated into the context of existing software platforms of genomics and transcriptomics at Bielefeld University. We demonstrate the potential of MeltDB by means of a sample experiment where we dissect the influence of three different carbon sources on the gram-negative bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris on the level of measured metabolites. Experimental data are stored, analyzed and annotated within MeltDB and accessible via the public MeltDB web server. Â© The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press.

Many putative EDs are widely used in commercial products regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) such as food packaging materials, ingredients of cosmetics, medical and dental devices, and drugs. The Endocrine Disruptor Knowledge Base (EDKB) project was initiated in the mid 1990's by the FDA as a resource for the study of EDs. The EDKB database, a component of the project, contains data across multiple assay types for chemicals across a broad structural diversity. This paper demonstrates the utility of EDKB database, an integral part of the EDKB project, for understanding and prioritizing EDs for testing.Results: The EDKB database currently contains 3,257 records of over 1,800 EDs from different assays including estrogen receptor binding, androgen receptor binding, uterotropic activity, cell proliferation, and reporter gene assays. Information for each compound such as chemical structure, assay type, potency, etc. is organized to enable efficient searching. A user-friendly interface provides rapid navigation, Boolean searches on EDs, and both spreadsheet and graphical displays for viewing results. The search engine implemented in the EDKB database enables searching by one or more of the following fields: chemical structure (including exact search and similarity search), name, molecular formula, CAS registration number, experiment source, molecular weight, etc. The data can be cross-linked to other publicly available and related databases including TOXNET, Cactus, ChemIDplus, ChemACX, Chem Finder, and NCI DTP. . Conclusion: The EDKB database enables scientists and regulatory reviewers to quickly access ED data from multiple assays for specific or similar compounds. The data have been used to categorize chemicals according to potential risks for endocrine activity, thus providing a basis for prioritizing chemicals for more definitive but expensive testing. The EDKB database is publicly available and can be found online at http://edkb.fda.gov/webstart/edkb/index.html.Disclaimer:The views presented in this article do not necessarily reflect those of the US Food and Drug Administration.

By providing a database in a curated, machine readable way, omics data analysis and visualization is enabled. WikiPathways and other pathway databases are used to analyze experimental data by research groups in many fields. Due to the open and collaborative nature of the WikiPathways platform, our content keeps growing and is getting more accurate, making WikiPathways a reliable and rich pathway database. Previously, however, the focus was primarily on genes and proteins, leaving many metabolites with only limited annotation. Recent curation efforts focused on improving the annotation of metabolism and metabolic pathways by associating unmapped metabolites with database identifiers and providing more detailed interaction knowledge. Here, we report the outcomes of the continued growth and curation efforts, such as a doubling of the number of annotated metabolite nodes in WikiPathways. Furthermore, we introduce an OpenAPI documentation of our web services and the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) annotation of resources to increase the interoperability of the knowledge encoded in these pathways and experimental omics data. New search options, monthly downloads, more links to metabolite databases, and new portals make pathway knowledge more effortlessly accessible to individual researchers and research communities.","title":"WikiPathways: A multifaceted pathway database bridging metabolomics to other omics research","authors":[{"name":"Slenter D.N."},{"name":"Kutmon M."},{"name":"Hanspers K."},{"name":"Riutta A."},{"name":"Windsor J."},{"name":"Nunes N."},{"name":"Melius J."},{"name":"Cirillo E."},{"name":"Coort S.L."},{"name":"DIgles D."},{"name":"Ehrhart F."},{"name":"Giesbertz P."},{"name":"Kalafati M."},{"name":"Martens M."},{"name":"Miller R."},{"name":"Nishida K."},{"name":"Rieswijk L."},{"name":"Waagmeester A."},{"name":"Eijssen L.M.T."},{"name":"Evelo C.T."},{"name":"Pico A.R."},{"name":"Willighagen E.L."}]},"pmid":"29136241","pmcid":"PMC5753270","type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkx1064"}],"elixirNode":["Netherlands"],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7542-0286","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Egon Willighagen","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"egon.willighagen@gmail.com","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Alexander Pico","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"alex.pico@gladstone.ucsf.edu","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8449-1318","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Denise Slenter","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":null,"url":null,"typeRole":[]},{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7699-8191","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Martina Kutmon","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":null,"url":null,"typeRole":[]},{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8624-2972","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Jonathan MÃ©lius","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":null,"url":null,"typeRole":[]},{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0241-7833","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Elisa Cirillo","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":null,"url":null,"typeRole":[]},{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1224-9690","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Susan Coort","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":null,"url":null,"typeRole":[]},{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2230-0840","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Marvin Martens","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":null,"url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["ChrisEvelo","LanfearJ","egonw"]},"owner":"shadi.m","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/manuals/rWikiPathways/man/rWikiPathways.pdf"}],"community":null,"version":["1.0.0"],"toolType":["Library"],"license":"MIT","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:rwikipathways","biotoolsID":"rwikipathways","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-11-26T15:32:32Z","name":"rWikiPathways","topic":[{"term":"Molecular interactions, pathways and networks","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0602"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Rare diseases","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3325"}],"additionDate":"2018-07-25T14:43:52Z","collectionID":["Rare Disease","BioConductor"],"homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rWikiPathways.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Neural networks for estimating microbe-metabolite interactions through their co-occurence probabilities.","language":["Python"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"https://github.com/biocore/mmvec"},{"note":"Code to generate benchmarks.

Ion mobility spectrometry coupled with multi-capillary columns (MCC/IMS), is a well known technology for detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in air. It is a comparatively inexpensive, non-invasive, high-throughput method, which is able to handle the moisture that comes with human exhaled air, and allows for characterizing of VOCs in very low concentrations. To identify discriminating compounds as biomarkers, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the detailed composition of human breath. Therefore, in addition to the clinical studies, there is a need for a flexible and comprehensive centralized data repository, which is capable of gathering all kinds of related information. Moreover, there is a demand for automated data integration and semi-automated data analysis, in particular with regard to the rapid data accumulation, emerging from the high-throughput nature of the MCC/IMS technology. Here, we present a comprehensive database application and analysis platform, which combines metabolic maps with heterogeneous biomedical data in a well-structured manner. The design of the database is based on a hybrid of the entity-attribute-value (EAV) model and the EAV-CR, which incorporates the concepts of classes and relationships. Additionally it offers an intuitive user interface that provides easy and quick access to the platform&rsquo;s functionality: automated data integration and integrity validation, versioning and roll-back strategy, data retrieval as well as semi-automatic data mining and machine learning capabilities. The platform will support MCC/IMS-based biomarker identification and validation. The software, schemata, data sets and further information is publicly available at http://imsdb.mpi-inf.mpg.de.","title":"An integrative clinical database and diagnostics platform for biomarker identification and analysis in ion mobility spectra of human exhaled air","authors":[{"name":"Schneider T."},{"name":"Hauschild A.-C."},{"name":"Baumbach J.I."},{"name":"Baumbach J."}]},"pmid":"23545212","pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.2390/biecoll-jib-2013-218"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Institute","name":"bmb.sdu.dk","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":null,"url":null,"typeRole":["Provider"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Jan Baumbach","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"jbaumbac@imada.sdu.dk","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["bjsommer"]},"owner":"veits@bmb.sdu.dk","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://imsdb.compbio.sdu.dk/"}],"community":null,"version":["1"],"toolType":["Workbench"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:imsdb","biotoolsID":"imsdb","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-09-18T18:30:17Z","name":"IMSDB","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Data mining","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3473"},{"term":"Data management","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3071"}],"additionDate":"2015-08-04T11:45:05Z","collectionID":["JIB.tools"],"homepage":"http://imsdb.compbio.sdu.dk"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":"The download website","type":["Other"],"url":"http://miolite2.iceht.forth.gr"}],"description":"The MESBL GC-MS metabolite peak database is a standardized library of more than 900 metabolite peaks from MS-reconstructed gas chromatograms integrating the in-house standard compound and peak library of the FORTH/ICE-HT Metabolic Engineering and Systems Biology Laboratory, Greece, appropriately filtered GOLM database peak information and Human Metabolome database information.","language":["Python"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[{"biotoolsID":"m-iolite","type":"usedBy"}],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":"List is incorporated in the M-IOLITE software but can also be obtained as a separate file upon request.","type":"Downloads page","version":"1.0","url":"http://miolite2.iceht.forth.gr"}],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Peak detection","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3215"},{"term":"Query and retrieval","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0224"},{"term":"Formatting","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0335"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":7,"journal":"IFAC-PapersOnLine","abstract":"Â© 2016Metabolomics, as a rapidly growing omic analysis, has being used extensively to explore the dynamic response of biological systems in several diseases/disorders and contexts. Therefore, it has become commonplace in a wide variety of disciplines and there is an intense need for development of software suites that provide the user with a less complicated and invalid analysis. These suites must integrate meta-analysis, a standardized data normalization method and a safe repository for all types of biological samples. In the case of the Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics, due to the complexity of the analysis, multiple procedures that are essential for the metabolite identification require special manipulation. Moreover, metabolomic analysis produces a vast amount of unidentified compound data, so there is a need for unknown peak identification methods. While a number of tools offer access to datasets, constantly providing new releases for data processing and the fact that considerable progress has been made in that area, there is no computational platform that emerges as a standardized approach which includes specialized normalization methods for GC-MS metabolomic analysis and incorporates the metabolic network analysis into data interpretation and unknown peak identification. To address these issues, as the datasets obtained from metabolomics experiments still remain extremely large and dense, we have implemented M-IOLITE, a computational suite for the efficient and automatic analysis of high-throughput metabolomic experiments. The aim of the suite is to streamline GC-MS metabolomic data analysis and to reduce complexity enabling the use of a friendly interface for processing, validating and annotating data. It integrates specialized normalization methods, a safe data repository and a peak library providing through its pipeline a useful tool which enables rapid and accurate analysis of the metabolomic profiles into an interactive system.","title":"Streamlining GC-MS metabolomic analysis using the M-IOLITE software suite","authors":[{"name":"Maga-Nteve C."},{"name":"Klapa M.I."}]},"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":["Other"],"version":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.12.140"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Maria Klapa","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"mklapa@iceht.forth.gr","url":"http://miolite2.iceht.forth.gr","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"mklapa","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":"The website provides information about citing the respective tool and how to contact the developer for obtaining the database.","type":["General"],"url":"http://miolite2.iceht.forth.gr"}],"community":null,"version":["1.0"],"toolType":["Library"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:miolite","biotoolsID":"miolite","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-07-26T16:58:29Z","name":"MESBL GC-MS metabolite peak database","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Laboratory techniques","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3361"},{"term":"Data identity and mapping","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3345"},{"term":"Cheminformatics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2258"},{"term":"Systems biology","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2259"},{"term":"Biochemistry","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3292"},{"term":"Biochemistry","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3292"}],"additionDate":"2017-09-11T15:08:17Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://miolite2.iceht.forth.gr"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Mirror"],"url":"https://github.com/13479776/statTarget"}],"description":"An easy to use tool provide a graphical user interface for quality control based shift signal correction, integration of metabolomic data from multi-batch experiments, and the comprehensive statistic analysis in non-targeted or targeted metabolomics.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[{"biotoolsID":"biocstyle","type":"uses"}],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Source code","version":null,"url":"http://bioconductor/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/statTarget_1.4.7.tar.gz"}],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Validation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2428"},{"term":"Regression analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3659"},{"term":"Statistical calculation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2238"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":1415,"journal":"Nature Methods","abstract":"Bioconductor is an open-source, open-development software project for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput data in genomics and molecular biology.

For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Summary Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is the favored method for untargeted metabolomic analysis of small molecules in biofluids. Here we present SimExTargId, an open-source R package for autonomous analysis of metabolomic data and real-time observation of experimental runs. This simultaneous, fully automated and multi-threaded (optional) package is a wrapper for vendor-independent format conversion (ProteoWizard), xcms- and CAMERA- based peak-picking, MetMSLine-based pre-processing and covariate-based statistical analysis. Users are notified of detrimental instrument drift or errors by email. Also included are two shiny applications, targetId for real-time MS2 target identification, and peakMonitor to monitor targeted metabolites.

All rights reserved.Motivation: Current informatic techniques for processing raw chromatography/mass spectrometry data break down under several common, non-ideal conditions. Importantly, hydrophilic liquid interaction chromatography (a key separation technology for metabolomics) produces data which are especially challenging to process. We identify three critical points of failure in current informatic workflows: compound specific drift, integration region variance, and naive missing value imputation. We implement the Warpgroup algorithm to address these challenges. Results: Warpgroup adds peak subregion detection, consensus integration bound detection, and intelligent missing value imputation steps to the conventional informatic workflow. When compared with the conventional workflow, Warpgroup made major improvements to the processed data. The coefficient of variation for peaks detected in replicate injections of a complex Escherichia Coli extract were halved (a reduction of 19%). Integration regions across samples were much more robust. Additionally, many signals lost by the conventional workflow were 'rescued' by the Warpgroup refinement, thereby resulting in greater analyte coverage in the processed data.

In this context, the technology has been increasingly used for differential profiling, i.e. broad screening of biomolecular components across multiple samples in order to elucidate the observed phenotypes and discover biomarkers. One of the major challenges in this domain remains development of better solutions for processing of LC/MS data. Results: We present a software package MZmine that enables differential LC/MS analysis of metabolomics data. This software is a toolbox containing methods for all data processing stages preceding differential analysis: spectral filtering, peak detection, alignment and normalization. Specifically, we developed and implemented a new recursive peak search algorithm and a secondary peak picking method for improving already aligned results, as well as a normalization tool that uses multiple internal standards. Visualization tools enable comparative viewing of data across multiple samples. Peak lists can be exported into other data analysis programs. The toolbox has already been utilized in a wide range of applications. We demonstrate its utility on an example of metabolic profiling of Catharanthus roseus cell cultures.

Both techniques have been revolutionized by the advent of mass spectrometers with detectors that afford high mass accuracy and resolution, such as time-of-flights (TOFs) and Orbitraps. One particular area where this technology is key is in the field of metabolic flux analysis because the resolution of these spectrometers allows for discrimination between 13C-containing isotopologues and those containing 15N or other isotopes. While XCMS-based software is freely available for untargeted analysis of mass spectrometric data sets, it does not always identify metabolites of interest in a targeted assay. Furthermore, there is a paucity of vendor-independent software that deals with targeted analyses of metabolites and of isotopologues in particular. Here, we present AssayR, an R package that takes high resolution wide-scan liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data sets and tailors peak detection for each metabolite through a simple, iterative user interface. It automatically integrates peak areas for all isotopologues and outputs extracted ion chromatograms (EICs), absolute and relative stacked bar charts for all isotopologues, and a.csv data file. We demonstrate several examples where AssayR provides more accurate and robust quantitation than XCMS, and we propose that tailored peak detection should be the preferred approach for targeted assays. In summary, AssayR provides easy and robust targeted metabolite and stable isotope analyses on wide-scan data sets from high resolution mass spectrometers.","title":"AssayR: A Simple Mass Spectrometry

In contrast to the fairly routine and automated data acquisition steps, subsequent compound annotation and identification require extensive manual analysis and thus form a major bottleneck in data interpretation. Here we present CAMERA, a Bioconductor package integrating algorithms to extract compound spectra, annotate isotope and adduct peaks, and propose the accurate compound mass even in highly complex data. To evaluate the algorithms, we compared the annotation of CAMERA against a manually defined annotation for a mixture of known compounds spiked into a complex matrix at different concentrations. CAMERA successfully extracted accurate masses for 89.7% and 90.3% of the annotatable compounds in positive and negative ion modes, respectively.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Efficient and accurate quantitation of metabolites fromLC-MS data has become an important topic. Here we present an automated tool, called iMet-Q (intelligent Metabolomic Quantitation), for label-freemetabolomics quantitation fromhigh-throughput MS1 data. By performing peak detection and peak alignment, iMet-Q provides a summary of quantitation results and reports ion abundance at both replicate level and sample level. Furthermore, it gives the charge states and isotope ratios of detected metabolite peaks to facilitate metabolite identification. An in-house standard mixture and a public Arabidopsismetabolome data set were analyzed by iMet-Q. Three public quantitation tools, including XCMS,MetAlign, andMZmine 2, were used for performance comparison. Fromthe mixture data set, seven standard metabolites were detected by the four quantitation tools, for which iMet-Q had a smaller quantitation error of 12%in both profile and centroid data sets. Our tool also correctly determined the charge states of seven standard metabolites. By searching the mass values for those standard metabolites against Human Metabolome Database, we obtained a total of 183metabolite candidates.With the isotope ratios calculated by iMet-Q, 49%(89 out of 183) metabolite candidates were filtered out. From the public Arabidopsis data set reported with two internal standards and 167 elucidatedmetabolites, iMet-Q detected all of the peaks corresponding to the internal standards and 167 metabolites. Meanwhile, our tool had small abundance variation (â¤0.19) when quantifying the two internal standards and had higher abundance correlation (â¥0.92) when quantifying the 167 metabolites. iMet-Q provides user-friendly interfaces and is publicly available for download at http://ms.iis.sinica.edu.tw/comics/Software-iMet-Q.html.","title":"IMet-Q: A user-friendly tool for label-free metabolomics quantitation using dynamic peak-width determination","authors":[{"name":"Chang H.-Y."},{"name":"Chen C.-T."},{"name":"Lih T.M."},{"name":"Lynn K.-S."},{"name":"Juo C.-G."},{"name":"Hsu W.-L."},{"name":"Sung T.-Y."}]},"pmid":"26784691","pmcid":"PMC4718670","type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0146112"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Ting-Yi Sung","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"tsung@iis.sinica.edu.tw","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"daniel_stefan","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://ms.iis.sinica.edu.tw/comics/Software/iMet-Q/iMet-Q_UserGuide.pdf"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":"Other","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:imet-q","biotoolsID":"imet-q","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-06-27T09:10:31Z","name":"iMet-Q","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"}],"additionDate":"2018-10-02T08:08:30Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://ms.iis.sinica.edu.tw/comics/Software_iMet-Q.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"The tool enables lipid annotation in high-throughput data derived from chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry.","language":[],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Command-line specification","version":null,"url":"http://genome.tugraz.at/lda2/lda_download.shtml"}],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[{"data":{"term":"Report","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2048"},"format":[{"term":"Graph format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3617"}]}],"input":[{"data":{"term":"Mass spectrometry data","uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2536"},"format":[{"term":"Mass spectrometry data format","uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3245"}]}],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Spectral analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3214"},{"term":"Annotation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0226"},{"term":"Structure analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2480"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2017-12-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":65,"journal":"Nature Methods","abstract":"Â© 2017 Nature America, Inc., part of Springer Nature.

The only way at present to address this discrepancy is to use in silico fragmentation software to identify unknown compounds by comparing and ranking theoretical MS/MS fragmentations from target structures to experimental tandem mass spectra (MS/MS). We compared the performance of four publicly available in silico fragmentation algorithms (MetFragCL, CFM-ID, MAGMa+ and MS-FINDER) that participated in the 2016 CASMI challenge. We found that optimizing the use of metadata, weighting factors and the manner of combining different tools eventually defined the ultimate outcomes of each method. We comprehensively analysed how outcomes of different tools could be combined and reached a final success rate of 93% for the training data, and 87% for the challenge data, using a combination of MAGMa+, CFM-ID and compound importance information along with MS/MS matching.

Here, we describe a lipidomics workflow and open-source software package for high-throughput annotation and putative identification of lipid, oxidized lipid, and oxylipin biomarkers in high-mass-accuracy HPLC-MS data. Lipid and oxylipin biomarker screening through adduct hierarchy sequences, or LOBSTAHS, uses orthogonal screening criteria based on adduct ion formation patterns and other properties to identify thousands of compounds while providing the user with a confidence score for each assignment. Assignments are made from one of two customizable databases; the default databases contain 14 068 unique entries. To demonstrate the software's functionality, we screened more than 340 000 mass spectral features from an experiment in which hydrogen peroxide was used to induce oxidative stress in the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. LOBSTAHS putatively identified 1969 unique parent compounds in 21 869 features that survived the multistage screening process. While P. tricornutum maintained more than 92% of its core lipidome under oxidative stress, patterns in biomarker distribution and abundance indicated remodeling was both subtle and pervasive.

Results: We herein developed an R package, metaX, that is capable of end-to-end metabolomics data analysis through a set of interchangeable modules.

All rights reserved.Motivation: Accurate cross-sample peak alignment and reliable intensity normalization is a critical step for robust quantitative analysis in untargetted metabolomics since tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is rarely used for compound identification. Therefore shortcomings in the data processing steps can easily introduce false positives due to misalignments and erroneous normalization adjustments in large sample studies. Results: In this work, we developed a software package MetTailor featuring two novel data preprocessing steps to remedy drawbacks in the existing processing tools. First, we propose a novel dynamic block summarization (DBS) method for correcting misalignments from peak alignment algorithms, which alleviates missing data problem due to misalignments. For the purpose of verifying correct re-alignments, we propose to use the cross-sample consistency in isotopic intensity ratios as a quality metric. Second, we developed a flexible intensity normalization procedure that adjusts normalizing factors against the temporal variations in total ion chromatogram (TIC) along the chromatographic retention time (RT). We first evaluated the DBS algorithm using a curated metabolomics dataset, illustrating that the algorithm identifies misaligned peaks and correctly realigns them with good sensitivity. We next demonstrated the DBS algorithm and the RT-based normalization procedure in a large-scale dataset featuring >100 sera samples in primary Dengue infection study. Although the initial alignment was successful for the majority of peaks, the DBS algorithm still corrected â¼7000 misaligned peaks in this data and many recovered peaks showed consistent isotopic patterns with the peaks they were realigned to. In addition, the RT-based normalization algorithm efficiently removed visible local variations in TIC along the RT, without sacrificing the sensitivity of detecting differentially expressed metabolites.

When a solid-state drive (SSD) was applied, the search time was 488 times shorter at 5 ppm mass tolerance and 1833 times at 0.1 ppm. Even if the search by HR2 was performed with 8 threads in a high-spec Windows 7 PC, the database search times were at least 26 and 115 times shorter without and with the SSD.

We developed MMMDB by performing non-targeted analyses of cerebra, cerebella, thymus, spleen, lung, liver, kidney, heart, pancreas, testis and plasma using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry and detected 428 non-redundant features from which 219 metabolites were successfully identified.

Very few existing tools address this aspect of analysis and those that do have shortfalls in usability or performance. We have developed an R package that implements retention time and mass spectra similarity threshold-free alignments, seamlessly integrates retention time standards for universally reproducible alignments, performs common ion filtering and provides compatibility with multiple peak quantification methods.

In particular, GC coupled to single quadrupole MS can be utilized for targeted analysis by selected ion monitoring (SIM). However, to our knowledge, there are no software tools specifically designed for analysis of GC-SIM-MS data. In this paper, we introduce a new R/Bioconductor package called SIMAT for quantitative analysis of the levels of targeted analytes. SIMAT provides guidance in choosing fragments for a list of targets. This is accomplished through an optimization algorithm that has the capability to select the most appropriate fragments from overlapping chromatographic peaks based on a pre-specified library of background analytes. The tool also allows visualization of the total ion chromatograms (TIC) of runs and extracted ion chromatograms (EIC) of analytes of interest. Moreover, retention index (RI) calibration can be performed and raw GC-SIM-MS data can be imported in netCDF or NIST mass spectral library (MSL) formats.RESULTS: We evaluated the performance of SIMAT using two GC-SIM-MS datasets obtained by targeted analysis of: (1) plasma samples from 86 patients in a targeted metabolomic experiment; and (2) mixtures of internal standards spiked in plasma samples at varying concentrations in a method development study. Our results demonstrate that SIMAT offers alternative solutions to AMDIS and MetaboliteDetector to achieve accurate detection of targets and estimation of their relative intensities by analysis of GC-SIM-MS data.CONCLUSIONS: We introduce a new R package called SIMAT that allows the selection of the optimal set of fragments and retention time windows for target analytes in GC-SIM-MS based analysis. Also, various functions and algorithms are implemented in the tool to: (1) read and import raw data and spectral libraries; (2) perform GC-SIM-MS data preprocessing; and (3) plot and visualize EICs and TICs.","title":"SIMAT: GC-SIM-MS data analysis tool","authors":[{"name":"Ranjbar M.R."},{"name":"Di Poto C."},{"name":"Wang Y."},{"name":"Ressom H.W."}]},"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.1186/s12859-015-0681-2"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Mo R.

Existing data preprocessing efforts have largely focused on methods which start by extracting features separately from each sample, followed by a subsequent attempt to group features across samples to facilitate comparisons. We show that this preprocessing approach leads to unnecessary variability in peak quantifications that adversely impacts downstream analysis. We present a new method, bakedpi, for the preprocessing of both centroid and profile mode metabolomics data that relies on an intensity-weighted bivariate kernel density estimation on a pooling of all samples to detect peaks. This new method reduces this unnecessary quantification variability and increases power in downstream differential analysis.

The workhorse in this field is gas-chromatography hyphenated with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The high-throughput of this technology coupled with a demand for large experiments has led to data pre-processing, i.e. the quantification of metabolites across samples, becoming a major bottleneck. Existing software has several limitations, including restricted maximum sample size, systematic errors and low flexibility. However, the biggest limitation is that the resulting data usually require extensive hand-curation, which is subjective and can typically take several days to weeks.Results: We introduce the TargetSearch package, an open source tool which is a flexible and accurate method for pre-processing even very large numbers of GC-MS samples within hours. We developed a novel strategy to iteratively correct and update retention time indices for searching and identifying metabolites. The package is written in the R programming language with computationally intensive functions written in C for speed and performance. The package includes a graphical user interface to allow easy use by those unfamiliar with R.Conclusions: TargetSearch allows fast and accurate data pre-processing for GC-MS experiments and overcomes the sample number limitations and manual curation requirements of existing software. We validate our method by carrying out an analysis against both a set of known chemical standard mixtures and of a biological experiment. In addition we demonstrate its capabilities and speed by comparing it with other GC-MS pre-processing tools. We believe this package will greatly ease current bottlenecks and facilitate the analysis of metabolic profiling data.

Metabolites participate in almost all cellular processes, but most metabolites still remain uncharacterized. Determination of the sum formula is a crucial step in the identification of an unknown metabolite, as it reduces its possible structures to a hopefully manageable set. Results: We present a method for determining the sum formula of a metabolite solely from its mass and the natural distribution of its isotopes. Our input is a measured isotope pattern from a high resolution mass spectrometer, and we want to find those molecules that best match this pattern. Our method is computationally efficient, and results on experimental data are very promising: for orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometry, we correctly identify sum formulas for >90% of the molecules, ranging in mass up to 1000 Da.

Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: Drift tube ion mobility spectrometry coupled with mass spectrometry (DTIMS-MS) is increasingly implemented in high throughput omics workflows, and new informatics approaches are necessary for processing the associated data. To automatically extract arrival times for molecules measured by DTIMS at multiple electric fields and compute their associated collisional cross sections (CCS), we created the PNNL Ion Mobility Cross Section Extractor (PIXiE). The primary application presented for this algorithm is the extraction of data that can then be used to create a reference library of experimental CCS values for use in high throughput omics analyses.Results: We demonstrate the utility of this approach by automatically extracting arrival times and calculating the associated CCSs for a set of endogenous metabolites and xenobiotics. The PIXiE-generated CCS values were within error of those calculated using commercially available instrument vendor software.Availability and implementation: PIXiE is an open-source tool, freely available on Github.

Our open source software OpenMZxy (http://www.bioprocess.org/openmzxy) enables automatic and manual sampling, as well as the recording of position data.For ionization we used a low-temperature plasma probe (LTP), coupled to a quadrupole mass analyzer. The current set-up has a practical resolution of 1. mm, and a sampling area of 100. Ã. 100. mm, resulting in up to 10,000 sampling points. Our prototype is easy and economical to adopt for different types of mass analyzers.We prove the usability of the LTP-MSI system for macroscopic samples by imaging the distribution of metabolites in the longitudinal cross-cut of a chili (Capsicum annuum, 'JalapeÃ±o pepper') fruit. The localization of capsaicin in the placenta could be confirmed. But additionally, yet unknown low molecular weight compounds were detected in defined areas, which underline the potential of LTP-MSI for the imaging of volatile and semi-volatile metabolites and for the discovery of new natural products.Biological significance. Knowledge about the spatial distribution of metabolites, proteins, or lipids in a given tissue often leads to novel findings in medicine and biology. Therefore, mass spectrometry based imaging (MSI) is becoming increasingly popular in life science research. However, the investment for necessary equipment is often prohibitive for small research groups.

OpenMS additionally provides a set of 185 tools and ready-made workflows for common mass spectrometric data processing tasks, which enable users to perform complex quantitative mass spectrometric analyses with ease.","title":"OpenMS: A flexible open-source software platform for mass spectrometry data analysis","authors":[{"name":"Rost H.L."},{"name":"Sachsenberg T."},{"name":"Aiche S."},{"name":"Bielow C."},{"name":"Weisser H."},{"name":"Aicheler F."},{"name":"Andreotti S."},{"name":"Ehrlich H.-C."},{"name":"Gutenbrunner P."},{"name":"Kenar E."},{"name":"Liang X."},{"name":"Nahnsen S."},{"name":"Nilse L."},{"name":"Pfeuffer J."},{"name":"Rosenberger G."},{"name":"Rurik M."},{"name":"Schmitt U."},{"name":"Veit J."},{"name":"Walzer M."},{"name":"Wojnar D."},{"name":"Wolski W.E."},{"name":"Schilling O."},{"name":"Choudhary J.S."},{"name":"Malmstrom L."},{"name":"Aebersold R."},{"name":"Reinert K."},{"name":"Kohlbacher O."}]},"pmid":"27575624","pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.1038/nmeth.3959"},{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":65,"journal":"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","abstract":"Proteomics experiments based on state-of-the-art mass spectrometry produce vast amounts of data, which cannot be analyzed manually. Hence, software is needed which is able to analyze the data in an automated fashion. The need for robust and reusable software tools triggered the development of libraries implementing different algorithms for the various analysis steps. OpenMS is such a software library and provides a wealth of data structures and algorithms for the analysis of mass spectrometric data. For users unfamiliar with programming, TOPP (\"The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline\") offers a wide range of already implemented tools sharing the same interface and designed for a specific analysis task each. TOPP thus makes the sophisticated algorithms of OpenMS accessible to nonprogrammers. The individual TOPP tools can be strung together into pipelines for analyzing mass spectrometry-based experiments starting from the raw output of the mass spectrometer. These analysis pipelines can be constructed using a graphical editor. Even complex analytical workflows can thus be analyzed with ease.","title":"OpenMS and TOPP: open source software for LC-MS data analysis.","authors":[{"name":"Bertsch A."},{"name":"Gropl

Bioinformatics","abstract":"Background: Today, data evaluation has become a bottleneck in chromatographic science. Analytical instruments equipped with automated samplers yield large amounts of measurement data, which needs to be verified and analyzed. Since nearly every GC/MS instrument vendor offers its own data format and software tools, the consequences are problems with data exchange and a lack of comparability between the analytical results. To challenge this situation a number of either commercial or non-profit software applications have been developed. These applications provide functionalities to import and analyze several data formats but have shortcomings in terms of the transparency of the implemented analytical algorithms and/or are restricted to a specific computer platform.Results: This work describes a native approach to handle chromatographic data files. The approach can be extended in its functionality such as facilities to detect baselines, to detect, integrate and identify peaks and to compare mass spectra, as well as the ability to internationalize the application. Additionally, filters can be applied on the chromatographic data to enhance its quality, for example to remove background and noise. Extended operations like do, undo and redo are supported.Conclusions: OpenChrom is a software application to edit and analyze mass spectrometric chromatographic data. It is extensible in many different ways, depending on the demands of the users or the analytical procedures and algorithms. It offers a customizable graphical user interface. The software is independent of the operating system, due to the fact that the Rich Client Platform is written in Java. OpenChrom is released under the Eclipse Public License 1.0 (EPL).

Compound identification is done by comparison of the MS data with compound libraries. Mass spectral libraries in the field of metabolomics ought to connect the relevant mass traces of the metabolites to other relevant data, e.g. formulas, chemical structures, identification numbers to other databases etc. Since existing solutions are either commercial and therefore only available for certain instruments or not capable of storing such information, there is need to provide a software tool for the management of such data. Results: Here we present mSpecs, an open source software tool to manage mass spectral data in the field of metabolomics. It provides editing of mass spectra and virtually any associated information, automatic calculation of formulas and masses and is extensible by scripts. The graphical user interface is capable of common techniques such as copy/ paste, undo/redo and drag and drop. It owns import and export filters for the major public file formats in order to provide compatibility to commercial instruments. Conclusion: mSpecs is a versatile tool for the management and editing of mass spectral libraries in the field of metabolomics. Beyond that it provides capabilities for the automatic management of libraries though its scripting functionality. mSpecs can be used on all major platforms and is licensed under the GNU General Public License and available at http://mspecs.tu-bs.de.

It performs over-representation or enrichment analysis with user-specified lists of metabolites and genes using over 3000 pre-annotated pathways from 11 databases. As a result, pathways can be identified that may be disregulated on the transcriptional level, the metabolic level or both. Evidence of pathway disregulation is combined, allowing for the identification of additional pathways with changed activity that would not be highlighted when analysis is applied to any of the functional levels alone. The tool has been implemented both as an interactive website and as a web service to allow a programming interface. Â© The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press.

While several techniques are available for the detection of significant peaks in individual samples, it is still difficult to determine small differences between similar samples. Using conventional software, visual inspections of individual chromatograms or individual mass spectra are often of little use because the differences in the composition of small molecules are too small to be recognizable. Thus, we developed a new approach to visualizing mass spectral datasets using a tool that allows one to easily detect these small differences between mass spectra and chromatograms derived from matched samples. Using these tools on extracts from wild-type and methyltransferase knockout strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we were able to readily identify those mass spectra in our data sets that were different between the wild-type and the knockout extracts and to identify the molecules involved. The software was also successfully applied to a set of LC/MS data from peptide digests that were performed with identical substrates but different enzymes.

Mass spectrometry is used routinely for bacterial identification and has also been used for phylogenetic analysis, for instance from bone material. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of the acquired tandem mass spectra allow direct interpretation. Methods: We describe a new algorithm and software for molecular phylogenetics using pairwise comparisons of tandem mass spectra from enzymatically digested proteins. The spectra need not be annotated and all acquired data is used in the analysis. To demonstrate the method, we analyzed tryptic digests of sera from four great apes and two other primates. Results: The distribution of spectra dot products for thousands of tandem mass spectra collected from two samples provides a measure on the fraction of shared peptides between the two samples. When inverted, this becomes a distance metric. By pairwise comparison between species and averaging over four individuals per species, it was possible to reconstruct the unique correct phylogenetic tree for the great apes and other primates. Conclusions: The new method described here has several attractive features compared with existing methods, among them simplicity, the unbiased use of all acquired data rather than a small subset of spectra, and the potential use of heavily degraded proteins or proteins with a priori unknown modifications.

They can be compared against predicted spectra of peptides derived from genome sequences, compared against previously acquired and identified spectra, or - sometimes - sequenced de novo. We recently introduced another method which compares spectra between liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) datasets to determine the shared spectral content, and demonstrated how this can be applied in a molecular phylogenetic study using sera from human and non-human primates. We will here explore if such a method have other, serendipitous uses. Methods We used the existing compareMS2 algorithm without modification on a diverse set of experiments. Results First we conducted a small phylogenetic study, using (mammalian) bone samples to study old material, and human pathogens aiming to distinguish clinically important strains. Although not as straightforward as primate sera analysis, the method shows significant promise for all these applications. We also used the algorithm to compare 24 different protocols for extraction of proteins from muscle tissue. The results provided useful information in comparing protocols. Finally, we applied compareMS2 aiming for quality control of two traceable protein reference standards (troponin) used in clinical chemistry assays, by analysing the effect of storage conditions. Conclusions The results illustrate a broad applicability of the metric based on shared tandem mass spectra between LC/MS/MS datasets for analysing protein digests in different types of experiments. There is no reason to assume that our instance of this method is optimal in any of these situations, as it makes limited or no use of accurate mass and chromatographic retention time. We propose that with further improvement and refinement, this type of analysis can be applied as a simple but informative first step in many pipelines for bottom-up tandem mass spectrometry data analysis in proteomics and other fields, comparing or analysing large numbers of samples or datasets.","title":"Differentiating samples and experimental protocols by direct comparison of tandem mass spectra","authors":[{"name":"Van Der Plas-Duivesteijn S.J."},{"name":"Wulff T."},{"name":"Klychnikov O."},{"name":"Ohana D."},{"name":"Dalebout H."},{"name":"Van Veelen P.A."},{"name":"De Keijzer J."},{"name":"Nessen M.A."},{"name":"Van Der Burgt Y.E.M."},{"name":"Deelder A.M."},{"name":"Palmblad M."}]},"pmid":"26864526","pmcid":null,"type":["Other"],"version":null,"doi":null}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Institute","name":"lumc.nl","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":null,"url":"https://www.lumc.nl","typeRole":["Provider"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5865-8994","typeEntity":null,"name":"Magnus Palmblad","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"magnus.palmblad@gmail.com","url":null,"typeRole":["Developer"]},{"note":null,"orcidid":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5865-8994","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Magnus Palmblad","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"magnus.palmblad@gmail.com","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"owner":"n.m.palmblad@lumc.nl","cost":"Free of charge","maturity":"Mature","confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://www.ms-utils.org/compareMS2.html"}],"community":null,"version":["1"],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":"GPL-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:comparems2","biotoolsID":"comparems2","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-03-26T08:13:35Z","name":"compareMS2","topic":[{"term":"Phylogeny","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0084"},{"term":"Proteomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121"},{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Proteomics experiment","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520"}],"additionDate":"2016-04-15T11:52:42Z","collectionID":["ms-utils","Proteomics"],"homepage":"http://www.ms-utils.org/compareMS2.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/babelomics/babelomics"}],"description":"Integrative platform for the analysis of Transcriptomics, Proteomics and Genomics data with advanced functional profiling.

Thus, it is challenging for users to perform such analyses, highlighting the need for a single tool for such purposes. The 3Omics one-click web tool was developed to visualize and rapidly integrate multiple human inter- or intra-transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data by combining five commonly used analyses: correlation networking, coexpression, phenotyping, pathway enrichment, and GO (Gene Ontology) enrichment.Results: 3Omics generates inter-omic correlation networks to visualize relationships in data with respect to time or experimental conditions for all transcripts, proteins and metabolites. If only two of three omics datasets are input, then 3Omics supplements the missing transcript, protein or metabolite information related to the input data by text-mining the PubMed database. 3Omics' coexpression analysis assists in revealing functions shared among different omics datasets. 3Omics' phenotype analysis integrates Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man with available transcript or protein data. Pathway enrichment analysis on metabolomics data by 3Omics reveals enriched pathways in the KEGG/HumanCyc database. 3Omics performs statistical Gene Ontology-based functional enrichment analyses to display significantly overrepresented GO terms in transcriptomic experiments. Although the principal application of 3Omics is the integration of multiple omics datasets, it is also capable of analyzing individual omics datasets. The information obtained from the analyses of 3Omics in Case Studies 1 and 2 are also in accordance with comprehensive findings in the literature.Conclusions: 3Omics incorporates the advantages and functionality of existing software into a single platform, thereby simplifying data analysis and enabling the user to perform a one-click integrated analysis.

The effectiveness of such methods depends on the availability of public open data across a broad range of experimental methods and conditions. The MetaboLights repository, powered by the open source ISA framework, is cross-species and cross-technique. It will cover metabolite structures and their reference spectra as well as their biological roles, locations, concentrations and raw data from metabolic experiments. Studies automatically receive a stable unique accession number that can be used as a publication reference (e.g. MTBLS1). At present, the repository includes 15 submitted studies, encompassing 93 protocols for 714 assays, and span over 8 different species including human, Caenor-habditis elegans, Mus musculus and Arabidopsis thaliana. Eight hundred twenty-seven of the metabolites identified in these studies have been mapped to ChEBI. These studies cover a variety of techniques, including NMR spectroscopyand mass spectrometry.

However, limited stability of experimental and instrument parameters may cause shifts and drifts of retention time and mass accuracy or the formation of different ion species, thus complicating conclusive interpretation of the raw data, especially when generated in different analytical batches. Here, a novel software tool for the semi-automated alignment of different measurement sequences is presented. The tool is implemented in the Java programming language, it features an intuitive user interface and its main goal is to facilitate the comparison of data obtained from different metabolomics experiments. Based on a feature list (i.e., processed LC-HRMS chromatograms with mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) values and retention times) that serves as a reference, the tool recognizes both m/z and retention time shifts of single or multiple analytical datafiles/batches of interest. MetMatch is also designed to account for differently formed ion species of detected metabolites. Corresponding ions and metabolites are matched and chromatographic peak areas, m/z values and retention times are combined into a single data matrix. The convenient user interface allows for easy manipulation of processing results and graphical illustration of the raw data as well as the automatically matched ions and metabolites. The software tool is exemplified with LC-HRMS data from untargeted metabolomics experiments investigating phenylalanine-derived metabolites in wheat and T-2 toxin/HT-2 toxin detoxification products in barley.","title":"MetMatch: A semi-automated software tool for the comparison and alignment of LC-HRMS data from different metabolomics experiments","authors":[{"name":"Koch S."},{"name":"Bueschl C."},{"name":"Doppler M."},{"name":"Simader A."},{"name":"Meng-Reiterer J."},{"name":"Lemmens M."},{"name":"Schuhmacher R."}]},"pmid":"27827849","pmcid":"PMC5192445","type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.3390/metabo6040039"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7520-4943","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Rainer Schuhmacher","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"rainer.schuhmacher@boku.ac.at","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"daniel_stefan","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"https://metabolomics-ifa.boku.ac.at/MetMatch/software/Documentation_1.0.0.pdf"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":"GPL-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:metmatch","biotoolsID":"metmatch","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2019-01-13T17:59:50Z","name":"MetMatch","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"}],"additionDate":"2018-08-28T13:43:41Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://metabolomics-ifa.boku.ac.at/MetMatch/index.html#"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"This package contains functions to perform end-to-end statistical analysis of LC/MS Metabolomic Data.

Databases require good quality spectra with sufficient compound information, but processing, calibration, noise reduction and retrieval of compound information are time-consuming tasks that prevent many contributions. We present a comprehensive workflow for the automatic processing of MS/MS using formula annotation for recalibration and cleanup to generate high quality spectra of standard compounds for upload to MassBank (www.massbank.jp). Compound information is retrieved via Internet services. Reference standards of 70 pesticides were measured at various collision energies on an LTQ-Orbitrap XL to develop and evaluate the workflow. A total of 944 resulting spectra are now available on MassBank. Evidence of nitrogen adduct formation during MS/MS fragmentation processes was found, highlighting the benefits high accuracy MS/MS offers for spectral interpretation. A database of recalibrated, cleaned-up spectra resulted in the most correct spectra ranked in first place, regardless of whether the search spectra were recalibrated or not, whereas the average rank of the correct molecular formula was improved from 2.55 (uncalibrated) to 1.53 when using recalibrated MS/MS data. The workflow is available as an R package RMassBank capable of generating MassBank records from raw MS and MS/MS data and can be adjusted to process data acquired with different settings and instruments. This workflow is a vital step towards addressing the need for more high quality, high accuracy MS/MS spectra in spectral databases and provides important information for spectral interpretation.

Identifying unknown structures from the mass spectra of natural product mixtures has been a desirable yet unresolved issue in metabolomics. However, this elucidation process has been hampered by complex experimental data and the inability of instruments to completely separate different compounds. Fortunately, with current high-resolution mass spectrometry, one feasible strategy is to define this problem as extending a scaffold database with sidechains of different probabilities to match the high-resolution mass obtained from a high-resolution mass spectrum. By introducing a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm, it is possible to solve this NP-complete problem in pseudo-polynomial time. However, the running time of the DP algorithm grows by orders of magnitude as the number of mass decimal digits increases, thus limiting the boost in structural prediction capabilities. By harnessing the heavily parallel architecture of modern GPUs, we designed a \"compute unified device architecture\" (CUDA)-based GPU-accelerated mixture elucidator (G.A.M.E.) that considerably improves the performance of the DP, allowing up to five decimal digits for input mass data. As exemplified by four testing datasets with verified constitutions from natural products, G.A.M.E. allows for efficient and automatic structural elucidation of unknown mixtures for practical procedures.","title":"G.A.M.E.: GPU-accelerated mixture elucidator","authors":[{"name":"Schurz A."},{"name":"Su B.-H."},{"name":"Tu Y.-S."},{"name":"Lu T.T.-Y."},{"name":"Lin O.A."},{"name":"Tseng Y.J."}]},"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1186/s13321-017-0238-7"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Yufeng J.

This remains one of the major challenges in NMR/mass spectrometry analysis of metabolic profiles. These features are mandatory to make metabolomics asserting a general approach to test a priori formulated hypotheses on the basis of exhaustive metabolome characterization rather than an exploratory tool dealing with unknown metabolic features. Objectives: In this article we propose a method, named ASICS, based on a strong statistical theory that handles automatically the metabolites identification and quantification in proton NMR spectra. Methods: A statistical linear model is built to explain a complex spectrum using a library containing pure metabolite spectra. This model can handle local or global chemical shift variations due to experimental conditions using a warping function. A statistical lasso-type estimator identifies and quantifies the metabolites in the complex spectrum. This estimator shows good statistical properties and handles peak overlapping issues. Results: The performances of the method were investigated on known mixtures (such as synthetic urine) and on plasma datasets from duck and human.

Pathway enrichment tools help in the identification of key metabolic processes and in building a plausible biological explanation for these variations. Although several methods are available for pathway enrichment using experimental evidence, metabolomics does not yet have a comprehensive overview in a network layout at multiple molecular levels. We propose a novel pathway enrichment procedure for analysing summary metabolomics data based on sub-network analysis in a graph representation of a reference database. Relevant entries are extracted from the database according to statistical measures over a null diffusive process that accounts for network topology and pathway crosstalk. Entries are reported as a sub-pathway network, including not only pathways, but also modules, enzymes, reactions and possibly other compound candidates for further analyses. This provides a richer biological context, suitable for generating new study hypotheses and potential enzymatic targets. Using this method, we report results from cells depleted for an uncharacterised mitochondrial gene using GC and LC-MS data and employing KEGG as a knowledge base. Partial validation is provided with NMR-based tracking of 13C glucose labelling of these cells.","title":"Null diffusion-based enrichment for metabolomics data","authors":[{"name":"Picart-Armada S."},{"name":"Fernandez-Albert F."},{"name":"Vinaixa M."},{"name":"Rodriguez M.A."},{"name":"Aivio S."},{"name":"Stracker T.H."},{"name":"Yanes O."},{"name":"Perera-Lluna A."}]},"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0189012"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Sergio Picart-Armada","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"sergi.picart@upc.edu","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"shadi.m","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/manuals/FELLA/man/FELLA.pdf"}],"community":null,"version":["1.0.0"],"toolType":["Library"],"license":"GPL-3.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:fella","biotoolsID":"fella","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2018-12-10T12:59:00Z","name":"FELLA","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"}],"additionDate":"2018-07-08T16:02:00Z","collectionID":["BioConductor"],"homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/FELLA.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"A Comprehensive Relational Database of Metabolomics Pathways for Pathway Enrichment Analysis of Genes and Metabolites.","language":["R","SQL"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Query and retrieval","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0224"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2018-03-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":12,"journal":"Metabolites","abstract":"Â© 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The value of metabolomics in translational research is undeniable, and metabolomics data are increasingly generated in large cohorts. The functional interpretation of disease-associated metabolites though is difficult, and the biological mechanisms that underlie cell type or disease-specific metabolomics profiles are oftentimes unknown. To help fully exploit metabolomics data and to aid in its interpretation, analysis of metabolomics data with other complementary omics data, including transcriptomics, is helpful. To facilitate such analyses at a pathway level, we have developed RaMP (Relational database of Metabolomics Pathways), which combines biological pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Reactome, WikiPathways, and the Human Metabolome DataBase (HMDB). To the best of our knowledge, an off-the-shelf, public database that maps genes and metabolites to biochemical/disease pathways and can readily be integrated into other existing software is currently lacking. For consistent and comprehensive analysis, RaMP enables batch and complex queries (e.g., list all metabolites involved in glycolysis and lung cancer), can readily be integrated into pathway analysis tools, and supports pathway overrepresentation analysis given a list of genes and/or metabolites of interest. For usability, we have developed a RaMP R package (https://github.com/Mathelab/RaMP-DB), including a user-friendly RShiny web application, that supports basic simple and batch queries, pathway overrepresentation analysis given a list of genes or metabolites of interest, and network visualization of gene-metabolite relationships. The package also includes the raw database file (mysql dump), thereby providing a stand-alone downloadable framework for public use and integration with other tools. In addition, the Python code needed to recreate the database on another system is also publicly available (https://github.com/Mathelab/RaMP-BackEnd). Updates for databases in RaMP will be checked multiple times a year and RaMP will be updated accordingly.","title":"RaMP: A comprehensive relational database of metabolomics pathways for pathway enrichment analysis of genes and metabolites","authors":[{"name":"Zhang B."},{"name":"Hu S."},{"name":"Baskin E."},{"name":"Patt A."},{"name":"Siddiqui J.K."},{"name":"Mathe E.A."}]},"pmid":"29470400","pmcid":"PMC5876005","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.3390/metabo8010016"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Ewy A.

Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation Biobanks are important infrastructures for life science research. Optimal sample handling regarding e.g. collection and processing of biological samples is highly complex, with many variables that could alter sample integrity and even more complex when considering multiple study centers or using legacy samples with limited documentation on sample management. Novel means to understand and take into account such variability would enable high-quality research on archived samples. Results This study investigated whether pre-analytical sample variability could be predicted and reduced by modeling alterations in the plasma metabolome, measured by NMR, as a function of pre-centrifugation conditions (1-36 h pre-centrifugation delay time at 4 Â°C and 22 Â°C) in 16 individuals. Pre-centrifugation temperature and delay times were predicted using random forest modeling and performance was validated on independent samples. Alterations in the metabolome were modeled at each temperature using a cluster-based approach, revealing reproducible effects of delay time on energy metabolism intermediates at both temperatures, but more pronounced at 22 Â°C. Moreover, pre-centrifugation delay at 4 Â°C resulted in large, specific variability at 3 h, predominantly of lipids. Pre-analytical sample handling error correction resulted in significant improvement of data quality, particularly at 22 Â°C. This approach offers the possibility to predict pre-centrifugation delay temperature and time in biobanked samples before use in costly downstream applications. Moreover, the results suggest potential to decrease the impact of undesired, delay-induced variability. However, these findings need to be validated in multiple, large sample sets and with analytical techniques covering a wider range of the metabolome, such as LC-MS.

In metabolic networks, chemical reactions transform reactants into products, thereby transferring elements between these metabolites. Knowledge of how elements are transferred through reactant/ product pairs allows for the identification of primary compound connections through a metabolic network. However, such information is not readily available and is often challenging to obtain for large reaction databases or genome-scale metabolic models. In this study, a new algorithm was developed for automatically predicting the element-transferring reactant/ product pairs using the limited information available in the standard representation of metabolic networks. The algorithm demonstrated high efficiency in analyzing large datasets and provided accurate predictions when benchmarked with manually curated data. Applying the algorithm to the visualization of metabolic networks highlighted pathways of primary reactant/product connections and provided an organized view of element-transferring biochemical transformations. The algorithm was implemented as a new function in the open source software package PSAMM in the release v0.30 (https://zhanglab.github.io/psamm/).","title":"FindPrimaryPairs: An efficient algorithm for predicting element-transferring reactant/ product pairs in metabolic networks","authors":[{"name":"Steffensen J.L."},{"name":"Dufault-Thompson K."},{"name":"Zhang Y."}]},"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0192891"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Ying Zhang","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"yingzhang@uri.edu","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"migle_sur","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://psamm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Library"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:psamm","biotoolsID":"psamm","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2018-12-10T12:58:59Z","name":"PSAMM","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Molecular interactions, pathways and networks","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0602"}],"additionDate":"2018-07-03T15:51:46Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://zhanglab.github.io/psamm/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://www.mybiosoftware.com/metabosearch-mass-based-metabolite-identification-using-multiple-databases.html"}],"description":"Performs mass-based metabolite search simultaneously against the four major metabolite databases: Human Metabolome DataBase (HMDB), Madison Metabolomics Consortium Database (MMCD), Metlin, and LipidMaps.","language":["Java"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Search","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2421"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":null,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0040096.PMID:22768229"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Support","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"hwr@georgetown.edu","url":"http://omics.georgetown.edu/","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"mbs_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://omics.georgetown.edu/metabosearch.html"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Desktop application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:metabosearch","biotoolsID":"metabosearch","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2018-12-10T12:58:58Z","name":"metabosearch","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Databases","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3489"}],"additionDate":"2017-12-18T00:15:13Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://omics.georgetown.edu/metabosearch.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://www.mybiosoftware.com/metap-2-web-based-metabolomics-data-analysis-tool.html"}],"description":"The server automates data analysis for the processing of metabolomics experiments.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Processing","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2409"}]},{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2945"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":52,"journal":"Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology","abstract":"Metabolomics is an emerging field that is based on the quantitative measurement of as many small organic molecules occurring in a biological sample as possible. Due to recent technical advances, metabolomics can now be used widely as an analytical high-throughput technology in drug testing and epidemiological metabolome and genome wide association studies. Analogous to chip-based gene expression analyses, the enormous amount of data produced by modern kit-based metabolomics experiments poses new challenges regarding their biological interpretation in the context of various sample phenotypes. We developed metaP-server to facilitate data interpretation. metaP-server provides automated and standardized data analysis for quantitative metabolomics data, covering the following steps from data acquisition to biological interpretation: (i) data quality checks, (ii) estimation of reproducibility and batch effects, (iii) hypothesis tests for multiple categorical phenotypes, (iv) correlation tests for metric phenotypes, (v) optionally including all possible pairs of metabolite concentration ratios, (vi) principal component analysis (PCA), and (vii) mapping of metabolites onto colored KEGG pathway maps. Graphical output is clickable and cross-linked to sample and metabolite identifiers. Interactive coloring of PCA and bar plots by phenotype facilitates on-line data exploration.

The environmental metabolome and metabolic potential of microorganisms are dominant and essential factors shaping microbial community composition. Recent advances in genome annotation and systems biology now allow us to semiautomatically reconstruct genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) of microorganisms based on their genome sequence 1 . Next, growth of these models in a defined metabolic environment can be predicted in silico, mechanistically linking the metabolic fluxes of individual microbial populations to the community dynamics. A major advantage of GSMMs is that no training data is needed, besides information about the metabolic capacity of individual genes (genome annotation) and knowledge of the available environmental metabolites that allow the microorganism to grow. However, the composition of the environment is often not fully determined and remains difficult to measure 2 . We hypothesized that the relative abundance of different bacterial species, as measured by metagenomics, can be combined with GSMMs of individual bacteria to reveal the metabolic status of a given biome. Using a newly developed algorithm involving over 1,500 GSMMs of human-associated bacteria, we inferred distinct metabolomes for four human body sites that are consistent with experimental data. Together, we link the metagenome to the metabolome in a mechanistic framework towards predictive microbiome modelling.","title":"Towards predicting the environmental metabolome from metagenomics with a mechanistic model","authors":[{"name":"Garza D.R."},{"name":"Van Verk M.C."},{"name":"Huynen M.A."},{"name":"Dutilh B.E."}]},"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1038/s41564-018-0124-8"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Bas E.

Recently, LC/MS-based untargeted metabolomics and isotopically labeled metabolites have been used to facilitate the unbiased mapping of labeled moieties through metabolic pathways. However, due to the complexity of the resulting experimental data sets few computational tools are available for data analysis. Here we introduce geoRge, a novel computational approach capable of analyzing untargeted LC/MS data from stable isotope-labeling experiments. geoRge is written in the open language R and runs on the output structure of the XCMS package, which is in widespread use. As opposed to the few existing tools, which use labeled samples to track stable isotopes by iterating over all MS signals using the theoretical mass difference between the light and heavy isotopes, geoRge uses unlabeled and labeled biologically equivalent samples to compare isotopic distributions in the mass spectra. Isotopically enriched compounds change their isotopic distribution as compared to unlabeled compounds. This is directly reflected in a number of new m/z peaks and higher intensity peaks in the mass spectra of labeled samples relative to the unlabeled equivalents. The automated untargeted isotope annotation and relative quantification capabilities of geoRge are demonstrated by the analysis of LC/MS data from a human retinal pigment epithelium cell line (ARPE-19) grown on normal and high glucose concentrations mimicking diabetic retinopathy conditions in vitro. In addition, we compared the results of geoRge with the outcome of X13CMS, since both approaches rely entirely on XCMS parameters for feature selection, namely m/z and retention time values. To ensure data traceability and reproducibility, and enabling for comparison with other existing and future approaches, raw LC/MS files have been deposited in MetaboLights (MTBLS213) and geoRge is available as an R script at https://github.com/jcapelladesto/geoRge.","title":"GeoRge: A Computational Tool to Detect the Presence of Stable Isotope Labeling in LC/MS-Based Untargeted Metabolomics","authors":[{"name":"Capellades J."},{"name":"Navarro M."},{"name":"Samino S."},{"name":"Garcia-Ramirez M."},{"name":"Hernandez C."},{"name":"Simo R."},{"name":"Vinaixa M."},{"name":"Yanes O."}]},"pmid":"26639619","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/acs.analchem.5b03628"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Jordi Capellades","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"j.capellades.to@gmail.com","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"aotamendi.1","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"https://github.com/jcapelladesto/geoRge/blob/master/vignettes/geoRge.Rmd"}],"community":null,"version":["1.0"],"toolType":["Library"],"license":"GPL-3.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:george","biotoolsID":"george","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2018-12-10T12:58:58Z","name":"geoRge","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"}],"additionDate":"2018-05-22T15:38:17Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://github.com/jcapelladesto/geoRge"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Web-based pipeline for metabolomic data processing, statistical analysis and functional interpretation.

In an effort to simplify metabolomic data analysis while at the same time improving user accessibility, we have developed a freely accessible, easy-to-use web server for metabolomic data analysis called MetaboAnalyst. Fundamentally, MetaboAnalyst is a web-based metabolomic data processing tool not unlike many of today's web-based microarray analysis packages. It accepts a variety of input data (NMR peak lists, binned spectra, MS peak lists, compound/concentration data) in a wide variety of formats. It also offers a number of options for metabolomic data processing, data normalization, multivariate statistical analysis, graphing, metabolite identification and pathway mapping. In particular, MetaboAnalyst supports such techniques as: fold change analysis, t-tests, PCA, PLS-DA, hierarchical clustering and a number of more sophisticated statistical or machine learning methods. It also employs a large library of reference spectra to facilitate compound identification from most kinds of input spectra. MetaboAnalyst guides users through a step-by-step analysis pipeline using a variety of menus, information hyperlinks and check boxes. Upon completion, the server generates a detailed report describing each method used, embedded with graphical and tabular outputs.

However, the difficulties in data management and the complexities of analytical approaches have significantly limited data integration to enable meta-analysis. Here, we introduce integrative meta-analysis of expression data (INMEX), a user-friendly web-based tool designed to support meta-analysis of multiple gene-expression data sets, as well as to enable integration of data sets from gene expression and metabolomics experiments. INMEX contains three functional modules. The data preparation module supports flexible data processing, annotation and visualization of individual data sets. The statistical analysis module allows researchers to combine multiple data sets based on P-values, effect sizes, rank orders and other features. The significant genes can be examined in functional analysis module for enriched Gene Ontology terms or Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, or expression profile visualization.

The recently discovered qnr genes provide a mechanism of resistance with the potential to rapidly spread between bacteria using horizontal gene transfer. As for many antibiotic resistance genes present in pathogens today, qnr genes are hypothesized to originate from environmental bacteria. The vast amount of data generated by shotgun metagenomics can therefore be used to explore the diversity of qnr genes in more detail.Results: In this paper we describe a new method to identify qnr genes in nucleotide sequence data. We show, using cross-validation, that the method has a high statistical power of correctly classifying sequences from novel classes of qnr genes, even for fragments as short as 100 nucleotides. Based on sequences from public repositories, the method was able to identify all previously reported plasmid-mediated qnr genes. In addition, several fragments from novel putative qnr genes were identified in metagenomes. The method was also able to annotate 39 chromosomal variants of which 11 have previously not been reported in literature.Conclusions: The method described in this paper significantly improves the sensitivity and specificity of identification and annotation of qnr genes in nucleotide sequence data. The predicted novel putative qnr genes in the metagenomic data support the hypothesis of a large and uncharacterized diversity within this family of resistance genes in environmental bacterial communities.

Many microarray studies have analysed transcriptomic data from a pathway perspective, for instance by testing for KEGG pathway enrichment in sets of upregulated genes. However, the increasing availability of species-specific metabolic models provides the opportunity to analyse these data in a more objective, system-wide manner.Results: Here we introduce ambient (Active Modules for Bipartite Networks), a simulated annealing approach to the discovery of metabolic subnetworks (modules) that are significantly affected by a given genetic or environmental change. The metabolic modules returned by ambient are connected parts of the bipartite network that change coherently between conditions, providing a more detailed view of metabolic changes than standard approaches based on pathway enrichment.Conclusions: ambient is an effective and flexible tool for the analysis of high-throughput data in a metabolic context. The same approach can be applied to any system in which reactions (or metabolites) can be assigned a score based on some biological observation, without the limitation of predefined pathways.

Results: We introduce a probabilistic approach Bayesian Quantification (BQuant), for fully automated database-based identification and quantification of metabolites in local regions of 1H NMR spectra. The approach represents the spectra as mixtures of reference profiles from a database, and infers the identities and the abundances of metabolites by Bayesian model selection. We show using a simulated dataset, a spike-in experiment and a metabolomic investigation of plasma samples that BQuant outperforms the available automated alternatives in accuracy for both identification and quantification.

While GSEA has been playing a significant role in understanding transcriptomic data, no similar tools are currently available for understanding metabolomic data. Here, we introduce a web-based server, called Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA), to help researchers identify and interpret patterns of human or mammalian metabolite concentration changes in a biologically meaningful context. Key to the development of MSEA has been the creation of a library of ~1000 predefined metabolite sets covering various metabolic pathways, disease states, biofluids, and tissue locations. MSEA also supports user-defined or custom metabolite sets for more specialized analysis. MSEA offers three different enrichment analyses for metabolomic studies including overrepresentation analysis (ORA), single sample profiling (SSP) and quantitative enrichment analysis (QEA). ORA requires only a list of compound names, while SSP and QEA require both compound names and compound concentrations. MSEA generates easily understood graphs or tables embedded with hyperlinks to relevant pathway images and disease descriptors. For nonmammalian or more specialized metabolomic studies, MSEA allows users to provide their own metabolite sets for enrichment analysis. The MSEA server also supports conversion between metabolite common names, synonyms, and major database identifiers. MSEA has the potential to help users identify obvious as well as 'subtle but coordinated' changes among a group of related metabolites that may go undetected with conventional approaches.

While the concept of metabolomics is relatively new to organ transplantation, the idea of measuring metabolites as a quick, noninvasive probe of organ function is not. Indeed, metabolite measurements of serum creatinine have long been used to assess pre- and post-operative organ function. Over the past 10 years, a number of lesser-known, organ-specific metabolites have also been shown to be good diagnostic indicators of both organ function and viability. In general, metabolomics offers a complementary picture to what can be revealed via techniques based on genomics, proteomics or histology. Because metabolic changes typically happen within seconds or minutes after an 'event', whereas some transcript, protein abundance or tissue changes may take place over days or weeks, metabolomic measurements may offer a particularly useful and inexpensive diagnostic tool to monitor donor organ viability or to detect organ rejection. The excitement associated with metabolomics, however, must be tempered by the fact that the technology for rapid metabolite identification is still in its infancy, and that metabolites are but one part of a very complex picture pertaining to organ function.

The most recent release of HMDB (version 2.0) has been significantly expanded and enhanced over the previous release (version 1.0). In particular, the number of fully annotated metabolite entries has grown from 2180 to more than 6800 (a 300% increase), while the number of metabolites with biofluid or tissue concentration data has grown by a factor of five (from 883 to 4413).

These include better algorithms for spectral searching and matching, more powerful chemical substructure searches, faster text searching software, as well as dedicated pathway searching tools and customized, clickable metabolic maps.

There are several software packages that support compound identification and quantification via 1D 1H NMR by spectral fitting techniques. Because 1D 1H NMR spectra are characterized by extensive peak overlap or spectral congestion, two-dimensional (2D) NMR, with its increased spectral resolution, could potentially improve and even automate compound identification or quantification. However, the lack of dedicated software for this purpose significantly restricts the application of 2D NMR methods to most metabolomic studies. Results: We describe a standalone graphics software tool, called MetaboMiner, which can be used to automatically or semi-automatically identify metabolites in complex biofluids from 2D NMR spectra. MetaboMiner is able to handle both 1H-1H total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) and 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) data. It identifies compounds by comparing 2D spectral patterns in the NMR spectrum of the biofluid mixture with specially constructed libraries containing reference spectra of â¼500 pure compounds. Tests using a variety of synthetic and real spectra of compound mixtures showed that MetaboMiner is able to identify >80% of detectable metabolites from good quality NMR spectra. Conclusion: MetaboMiner is a freely available, easy-to-use, NMR-based metabolomics tool that facilitates automatic peak processing, rapid compound identification, and facile spectrum annotation from either 2D TOCSY or HSQC spectra. Using comprehensive reference libraries coupled with robust algorithms for peak matching and compound identification, the program greatly simplifies the process of metabolite identification in complex 2D NMR spectra.

It has evolved very quickly during the last decade. However, metabolomics datasets are considered highly complex when used to relate metabolite levels to metabolic pathway activity. Despite recent developments in bioinformatics, which have improved the quality of metabolomics data, there is still no straightforward method capable of correlating metabolite level to the activity of different metabolic pathways operating within the cells. Thus, this kind of analysis still depends on extremely laborious and time-consuming processes. Results: Here, we present a new algorithm Pathway Activity Profiling (PAPi) with which we are able to compare metabolic pathway activities from metabolite profiles. The applicability and potential of PAPi was demonstrated using a previously published data from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. PAPi was able to support the biological interpretations of the previously published observations and, in addition, generated new hypotheses in a straightforward manner. However, PAPi is time consuming to perform manually. Thus, we also present here a new R-software package (PAPi) which implements the PAPi algorithm and facilitates its usage to quickly compare metabolic pathways activities between different experimental conditions. Using the identified metabolites and their respective abundances as input, the PAPi package calculates pathways' Activity Scores, which represents the potential metabolic pathways activities and allows their comparison between conditions. PAPi also performs principal components analysis and analysis of variance or t-test to investigate differences in activity level between experimental conditions. In addition, PAPi generates comparative graphs highlighting up-and down-regulated pathway activity. Â© The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press.

As metabolomics data are highdimensional, statistical data analysis is complex. No single technique for statistical analysis and biological interpretation of these ultracomplex data is sufficient to reveal the full information content of the data. Therefore a combination of univariate and multivariate statistics, network topology and biochemical pathway mapping analysis is in all cases recommended. Therefore, we developed a toolbox with fully graphical user interface support in MATLABÂ© called covariance inverse (COVAIN). COVAIN provides a complete workflow including uploading data, data preprocessing, uni- and multivariate statistical analysis, Granger time-series analysis, pathway mapping, correlation network topology analysis and visualization, and finally saving results in a user-friendly way. It covers analysis of variance, principal components analysis, independent components analysis, clustering and correlation coefficient analysis and integrates new algorithms, such as Granger causality and permutation entropy analysis that are not implemented in other similar softwares. Furthermore, we provide a new algorithm to reconstruct a differential Jacobian matrix of two different metabolic conditions. The algorithm is based on the assumptions of stochastic fluctuations in the metabolic network as described by us recently. By integrating the metabolomics covariance matrix and the stoichiometric matrix N of the corresponding pathways this approach allows for a systematic investigation of perturbation sites in the biochemical network based on metabolomics data. COVAIN was primarily developed for metabolomics data but can also be used for other omics data analysis. A C language programming module was integrated to handle computational intensive work for large datasets, e. g., genome-level proteomics and transcriptomics data sets which usually contain several thousand or more variables. COVAIN can perform cross analysis and integration between several datasets, which might be useful to investigate responses on different hierarchies of cellular contexts and to reveal the systems response as an integrated molecular network.

The task remains difficult, given the datasets' size, complexity, and common shifts in migration (elution/retention) times between samples analyzed by hyphenated mass spectrometry methods. Results: We present a Mathematica (Wolfram Research, Inc.) package MathDAMP (Mathematica package for Differential Analysis of Metabolite Profiles), which highlights differences between raw datasets acquired by hyphenated mass spectrometry methods by applying arithmetic operations to all corresponding signal intensities on a datapoint-by-datapoint basis. Peak identification and integration is thus bypassed and the results are displayed graphically. To facilitate direct comparisons, the raw datasets are automatically preprocessed and normalized in terms of both migration times and signal intensities. A combination of dynamic programming and global optimization is used for the alignment of the datasets along the migration time dimension. The processed datasets and the results of direct comparisons between them are visualized using density plots (axes represent migration time and m/z values while peaks appear as color-coded spots) providing an intuitive overall view. Various forms of comparisons and statistical tests can be applied to highlight subtle differences. Overlaid electropherograms (chromatograms) corresponding to the vicinities of the candidate differences from any result may be generated in a descending order of significance for visual confirmation. Additionally, a standard library table (a list of m/z values and migration times for known compounds) may be aligned and overlaid on the plots to allow easier identification of metabolites. Conclusion: Our tool facilitates the visualization and identification of differences between complex metabolite profiles according to various criteria in an automated fashion and is useful for data-driven discovery of biomarkers and functional genomics.

MetCirc comprises functionalities to interactively organize these data according to compound familial groupings and to accelerate the discovery of shared metabolites and hypothesis formulation for unknowns. As such, MetCirc provides a significant advance to address biological questions in areas where chemodiversity plays a role.","title":"MetCirc: Navigating mass spectral similarity in high-resolution MS/MS metabolomics data","authors":[{"name":"Naake T."},{"name":"Gaquerel E."}]},"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btx159"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Thomas Naake","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"thomasnaake@googlemail.com","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"bioconductor_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MetCirc.html"}],"community":null,"version":["1.0.1"],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Library"],"license":"GPL-2.0","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:metcirc","biotoolsID":"metcirc","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2018-12-10T12:58:51Z","name":"MetCirc","topic":[{"term":"Metabolomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3172"},{"term":"Molecular interactions, pathways and networks","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0602"},{"term":"Systems biology","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2259"}],"additionDate":"2017-01-17T15:04:48Z","collectionID":["BioConductor"],"homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MetCirc.html"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://www.mybiosoftware.com/metabnorm-a-mixed-model-normalization-method-for-metabolomics-data.html"}],"description":"Mixed model normalization method for metabolomics data.","language":["R"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Standardisation and normalisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3435"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2014-08-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":30,"journal":"Bioinformatics","abstract":"Motivation: In metabolomics, the goal is to identify and measure the concentrations of different metabolites (small molecules) in a cell or a biological system. The metabolites form an important layer in the complex metabolic network, and the interactions between different metabolites are often of interest. It is crucial to perform proper normalization of metabolomics data, but current methods may not be applicable when estimating interactions in the form of correlations between metabolites. We propose a normalization approach based on a mixed model, with simultaneous estimation of a correlation matrix. We also investigate how the common use of a calibration standard in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments affects the estimation of correlations. Results: We show with both real and simulated data that our proposed normalization method is robust and has good performance when discovering true correlations between metabolites. The standardization of NMR data is shown in simulation studies to affect our ability to discover true correlations to a small extent. However, comparing standardized and non-standardized real data does not result in any large differences in correlation estimates.

Such analysis produces a set of peaks, or features, indicative of the metabolic composition of the sample and may be used as a basis for sample classification. Feature selection may be employed to improve classification accuracy or aid model explanation by establishing a subset of class discriminating features. Factors such as experimental noise, choice of technique and threshold selection may adversely affect the set of selected features retrieved. Furthermore, the high dimensionality and multi-collinearity inherent within metabolomics data may exacerbate discrepancies between the set of features retrieved and those required to provide a complete explanation of metabolite signatures. Given these issues, the latter in particular, we present the MetaFIND application for 'post-feature selection' correlation analysis of metabolomics data. Results: In our evaluation we show how MetaFIND may be used to elucidate metabolite signatures from the set of features selected by diverse techniques over two metabolomics datasets. Importantly, we also show how MetaFIND may augment standard feature selection and aid the discovery of additional significant features, including those which represent novel class discriminating metabolites. MetaFIND also supports the discovery of higher level metabolite correlations. Conclusion: Standard feature selection techniques may fail to capture the full set of relevant features in the case of high dimensional, multi-collinear metabolomics data. We show that the MetaFIND 'post-feature selection' analysis tool may aid metabolite signature elucidation, feature discovery and inference of metabolic correlations.

Based on these features, reclassifying selected internal nodes (separators) to external ones can be used to divide a large complex metabolic network into simpler subnetworks. Selection of separators based on node connectivity is commonly used but affords little detailed control and tends to produce excessive fragmentation.The method proposed here (Netsplitter) allows the user to control separator selection. It combines local connection degree partitioning with global connectivity derived from random walks on the network, to produce a more even distribution of subnetwork sizes. Partitioning is performed progressively and the interactive visual matrix presentation used allows the user considerable control over the process, while incorporating special strategies to maintain the network integrity and minimise the information loss due to partitioning.Results: Partitioning of a genome scale network of 1348 metabolites and 1468 reactions for Arabidopsis thaliana encapsulates 66% of the network into 10 medium sized subnets. Applied to the flavonoid subnetwork extracted in this way, it is shown that Netsplitter separates this naturally into four subnets with recognisable functionality, namely synthesis of lignin precursors, flavonoids, coumarin and benzenoids. A quantitative quality measure called efficacy is constructed and shows that the new method gives improved partitioning for several metabolic networks, including bacterial, plant and mammal species.Conclusions: For the examples studied the Netsplitter method is a considerable improvement on the performance of connection degree partitioning, giving a better balance of subnet sizes with the removal of fewer mass balance constraints. In addition, the user can interactively control which metabolite nodes are selected for cutting and when to stop further partitioning as the desired granularity has been reached. Finally, the blocking transformation at the heart of the procedure provides a powerful visual display of network structure that may be useful for its exploration independent of whether partitioning is required.

A major technique for capturing metabolite data is 1H-NMR spectroscopy and this yields highly complex profiles that require sophisticated statistical analysis methods. However, experimental data is difficult to control and expensive to obtain. Thus data simulation is a productive route to aid algorithm development.Results: MetAssimulo is a MATLAB-based package that has been developed to simulate 1H-NMR spectra of complex mixtures such as metabolic profiles. Drawing data from a metabolite standard spectral database in conjunction with concentration information input by the user or constructed automatically from the Human Metabolome Database, MetAssimulo is able to create realistic metabolic profiles containing large numbers of metabolites with a range of user-defined properties. Current features include the simulation of two groups ('case' and 'control') specified by means and standard deviations of concentrations for each metabolite. The software enables addition of spectral noise with a realistic autocorrelation structure at user controllable levels. A crucial feature of the algorithm is its ability to simulate both intra- and inter-metabolite correlations, the analysis of which is fundamental to many techniques in the field. Further, MetAssimulo is able to simulate shifts in NMR peak positions that result from matrix effects such as pH differences which are often observed in metabolic NMR spectra and pose serious challenges for statistical algorithms.Conclusions: No other software is currently able to simulate NMR metabolic profiles with such complexity and flexibility. This paper describes the algorithm behind MetAssimulo and demonstrates how it can be used to simulate realistic NMR metabolic profiles with which to develop and test new data analysis techniques.

To design synthetic metabolic pathways of high value, computational methods are needed to expand present knowledge by mining comprehensive chemical and enzymatic information databases. Several computational methods have been already reported for the metabolic pathway design, but until now computation complexity has limited the diversity of chemical and enzymatic data used. Results: We introduce a computational platform, M-path, to explore synthetic metabolic pathways including putative enzymatic reactions and compounds. M-path is an iterative random algorithm, which makes efficient use of chemical and enzymatic databases to find potential synthetic metabolic pathways. M-path can readily control the search space and perform well compared with exhaustively enumerating possible pathways. A web-based pathway viewer is also developed to check extensive metabolic pathways with evaluation scores on the basis of chemical similarities. We further produce extensive synthetic metabolic pathways for a comprehensive set of alpha amino acids. The scalable nature of M-path enables us to calculate potential metabolic pathways for any given chemicals.

This impairment of mass spectra can have significant negative influence on further post-processing, like quantification and identification. METHODS A metric derived from the knowledge of errors in isotopic distribution patterns, and quality of the signal within a pre-defined mass chromatogram block, has been developed to pre-select all informative m/z channels. RESULTS This procedure results in the clean-up of deconvoluted mass spectra by maintaining the intensity counts from m/z channels that originate from a specific compound/molecular ion, for example, molecular ion, adducts, 13C-isotopes, multiply charged ions and removing all m/z channels that are not related to the specific peak. The methodology has been successfully demonstrated for two sets of high-resolution LC/MS data. CONCLUSIONS The approach described is therefore thought to be a useful tool in the automatic processing of LC/HRMS data. It clearly shows the advantages compared to other approaches like peak picking and de-isotoping in the sense that all information is retained while non-informative data is removed automatically.
